</p><h4>Body</h4><p><div class=""govspeak""><p>In the financial year 2014-15 Border Force detained over 1.6 million Intellectual Property (IP) infringing goods with a genuine retail value of £56 million.</p><br/><br/><p>Items include thousands of imitation designer handbags, clothes, jewellery, children’s toys and electrical goods which were destined for sale in the UK in the run-up to Christmas. </p><br/><br/><p>Once counterfeit items are detained, Border Force’s specialist international trade teams work with the owners of big brands to establish whether or not goods are genuine. If they are fake the goods are destroyed and the rights holders can then decide whether to privately prosecute the importers.</p><br/><br/><p>Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>The international trade in counterfeits is linked to serious and organised crime and undercuts honest traders, damaging our economy.</p><br/><br/>  <p>Customers are also left out of pocket with inferior and potentially dangerous goods.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">We are determined to crack down on this criminality and have Border Force officers working 24 hours a day at ports, airports and mail sorting centres to identify and seize counterfeits.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><figure class=""image embedded""><br/>  <div class=""img""><img alt=""Seizure "" src=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/47110/Count.Apple.MIA.doc960x640.jpg""></div><br/></figure><br/><br/><p>A spokesperson for the Intellectual Property Office said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>Tireless work by Border Force and IPO has sent a clear message to criminals trying to benefit from Intellectual Property theft. The UK is a world leader in IP enforcement – the government will support legitimate rights holders and aggressively pursue those breaking the law.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Counterfeiting and IP theft harms businesses and consumers alike. Christmas shoppers looking for a deal this year should be wary of bargains that look too good to be true, from cut price alcohol to heavily discounted electronics, and report anything suspicious.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><figure class=""image embedded""><br/>  <div class=""img""><img alt=""Seizure "" src=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/47109/Count_heelys_FXstowe_doc960x640.jpg""></div><br/></figure><br/><br/><p>Examples of recent detections made by Border Force include:        </p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>£3.5 million worth of items including £350,000 worth of Bulgari jewellery and £382,600 worth of Louis Vuitton designer handbags, as well as £152,000 worth of Michael Kors cosmetics at East Midlands Airport</li><br/>  <li>16,400 Apple branded data cables worth £410,000 and £75,000 worth of Givenchy and Celine designer handbags at Manchester Airport</li><br/>  <li>7,827 pairs of Heelys children’s trainers worth £391,350 at Felixstowe port</li><br/>  <li>1,500 Pokeman toys at Glasgow Airport</li><br/>  <li>4,536 pairs of Hello Kitty slippers worth £54,432, along with Moschino and Michael Kors designer handbags worth over £280,000 at Dover port</li><br/>  <li>1,198 pieces of branded clothing including Tommy Hilfiger, Fred Perry and Ralph Lauren at Heathrow Airport</li><br/>  <li>11,664 bottles of perfume including Paco Rabanne and Issay Miyake and 4,885 Samsung and Apple phone cases at Southampton port</li><br/>  <li>30 Burberry branded scarves worth over £10,000 at Edinburgh Airport</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Border Force North Deputy Director, Emma Porter said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>Counterfeiters will look to capitalise and cash in where there is a demand for a product and this year our officers have seized all sorts of fake goods – from beauty products to food and electrical goods.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">We urge consumers to be careful with their purchases. If the price appears too good to be true – either at a car boot sale, a market stall or online – it probably is.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Anyone who has been sold counterfeit goods or knows someone who is selling them should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.</p><br/></div></p>",

</p><h4>Body</h4><p><div class=""govspeak""><p>Sun Liu, 51, was stopped by officers at the airport as she arrived on a flight from Beijing via Amsterdam on 22 July 2012.</p><br/><br/><p>A suitcase containing traditional Chinese medicines was searched and six packets were found to contain items banned under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).</p><br/><br/><p>Three boxes (each containing 10 portions) contained ground rhinoceros horn, one box contained eight portions of a medicine containing bear bile and two boxes contained shenrong weisheng wan – a plant extract.</p><br/><br/><p>Liu was arrested at her home address of Dr China, Taff Street, Pontypridd, by National Crime Agency investigators in December 2012 and later charged with three counts of knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of a prohibition on the importation of goods.</p><br/><br/><p>She denied the offences but was found guilty yesterday (24 November) following a trial at Newport Crown Court. Sentence was immediately passed by the judge with Liu fined £750 for each of the three offences (£2,250 in total). She was also charged £1,500 costs.</p><br/><br/><p>Grant Miller, head of the Border Force CITES team, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>Just because items like this are available in other countries, it doesn’t mean they can be brought into the UK.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Border Force officers take their role in enforcing international agreements like CITES very seriously and anyone tempted to bring endangered animals and plants through our airports should think again.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Dawn Cartwright, from the National Crime Agency’s Border Policing Command, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>These items were restricted for a very good reason, to protect the endangered species of animals and plants they came from. I’ve no doubt they would have ended up on sale in the UK and it is the demand for these kinds of products which is having such a devastating impact on the species involved.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">I’m glad that with our Border Force colleagues we have been able to demonstrate that those caught trying to bring products like this to the UK will face arrest and prosecution.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Border Force is responsible for frontline detection and seizures of endangered animals and plants covered by the CITES convention.</p><br/><br/><p>Around 5,000 species of animals and 29,000 species of plants are protected by CITES, whether they are traded as live specimens or as derivatives.</p><br/><br/><p>In the year 2013 Border Force officers made 569 seizures under CITES regulations. Among the items seized were 486 live birds or animals, 280 live plants and more than 700,000 units of medicines made from parts or derivatives of endangered species.</p><br/><br/><p>Border Force officers are at the front line in protecting the country and play a key role in detecting illegal immigration, disrupting serious and organised crime and helping to prevent the threat of terrorism.  Border Force also protects the UK’s revenue, contributing to the nation’s prosperity and growth.</p><br/><br/><p>Criminal investigations launched as a result of Border Force seizures of prohibited items and goods are undertaken by officers from the National Crime Agency’s Border Policing Command. The NCA is leading the UK’s fight to cut serious and organised crime, including child exploitation, drug and people smuggling, illegal immigration and fraud and cyber crime.</p><br/><br/><p>Anyone with information about activity they suspect may be linked to smuggling should call our hotline on 0800 59 5000.</p><br/></div></p>",
