The government’s film tax relief generates almost £12.50 for every £1 spent and provides crucial support for UK films and filmmakers – it is a shrewd investment for the UK.</p><br/><br/>  <p>Britain’s film and creative industries give us much to be proud of, with British stories as diverse as Spectre and Suffragette winning the hearts and minds of audiences across the world while creating jobs and investment at home.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The creative sector tax reliefs, alongside lottery funding through the BFI, are a catalyst for creativity and innovation in storytelling in UK independent film, and are a key ingredient in the UK’s winning combination of outstanding talent and skills, world-leading studios and facilities, and iconic locations, which attracts film production from around the world.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Adrian Wootton, chief executive of the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.britishfilmcommission.org.uk/"">British Film Commission</a>, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>The UK’s creative sector tax reliefs have been a tremendous success, attracting inward investment through film, television and animation while stimulating growth in jobs and infrastructure across the UK, from London, Bristol and Manchester to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The boost they give our domestic screen industries is crucial, since the money generated by major inward investment titles helps create further training and business opportunities which allow our own independent productions to thrive, thus maintaining the UK’s status as a cultural powerhouse that is both creative and highly profitable.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Independent UK productions of all budgets have benefited from the film tax relief, receiving a third of total government support.</p><br/><br/><p>The UK film industry’s cutting edge skills in the fields of visual effects, sound production and world-class studios are making the UK an even more attractive place to make films. For example, the UK is home to many of the world’s leading VFX companies including those behind award-winning films such as Gravity.</p><br/><br/><p>As well as its creative and technology companies, the film industry relies upon a variety of sectors from catering to security, who have also felt the positive effects of the tax relief. BFI figures show that film production supports around 40,000 full-time jobs in the UK, which is a 22% increase from 2009.</p><br/><br/><p>Introduced in 2007, the film tax relief was extended to 25% for films of all budget levels on 1 April 2015 to support UK film making. The relief is available to films which qualify as British productions through a cultural test or via an official UK co-production treaty.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""key-facts-and-further-information"">Key facts and further information</h2><br/><br/><p>Based on UK expenditure from films which qualified for tax relief, there was an increase of 25% in industry investment into our creative economy in comparison to 2014.

Recent James Bond box-office smash Spectre was a UK produced – US financed film shot around the world, and across the UK, which is expected to be amongst the highest grossing films of 2015.</p><br/><br/><p>Other upcoming inward investment releases will include Eddie Redmayne’s venture into JK Rowling world of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the live action version of Beauty and the Beast and Knights of the Round Table: King Arthur.

There is no need to give personal details, and information that leads directly to an arrest could be considered for a small reward.</p><br/><br/><p>McGowan, 61, originally from Edinburgh, was arrested at a swimming pool in Valencia on 10 August by the Guardia Civil. He fled the UK 12 years ago after being found guilty of smuggling 28.3 million cigarettes into the country. His crimes robbed the UK of around £4 million in duty and he was sentenced in his absence in December 2001.</p><br/><br/><p>McGowan was part of a wider conspiracy to smuggle around 56 million cigarettes into the UK between November 1999 and March 2000. Ten other men were involved in the plot, which robbed the UK taxpayer of over £8.2 million.</p><br/><br/><p>Adrian Farley, Assistant Director of Criminal Investigation for HM Revenue &amp; Customs, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">McGowan is finally facing UK justice after 12 years on the run. We are determined to pursue fugitives and ensure they face the consequences of their criminal activity. HMRC would like to thank the Spanish authorities and UK organisations that assisted with this operation.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>The call to ring 900 988 922 comes as smugglers try to make huge profits from illegal imports of cigarettes, and the selling of low-quality, counterfeit cigarettes, tobacco and alcohol.</p><br/><br/><p>Customs officers are also keen for information about other items such as drugs, firearms, obscene material and endangered species. Tax frauds that HMRC want to hear about include betting and gaming, money laundering and the ‘carousel’ VAT scam in Europe.</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Smugglers and fraudsters cheat the rest of us by not contributing the tax that pays for schools, hospitals and public services”, said an HMRC spokesman.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">People in the British expatriate community can help us to find them.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/></div></p>",
