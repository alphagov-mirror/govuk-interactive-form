The importance of collaboration between US, EU and G7 in response to the violation of Ukrainian sovereignty was underlined. The European Council was in agreement that further infringement on Ukraine sovereignty would lead to broader trade and economic sanctions.</p><br/><br/><p>Asked about travel bans and asset freezing, the <abbr title=""Prime Minister’s Spokesperson"">PMS</abbr> said that preparatory work was underway and was being discussed by senior officials in London and in the EU. The European Council had agreed that there was an urgent need to establish dialogue between Ukraine and the Russian government to de-escalate the situation.

The government’s film tax relief generates almost £12.50 for every £1 spent and provides crucial support for UK films and filmmakers – it is a shrewd investment for the UK.</p><br/><br/>  <p>Britain’s film and creative industries give us much to be proud of, with British stories as diverse as Spectre and Suffragette winning the hearts and minds of audiences across the world while creating jobs and investment at home.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The creative sector tax reliefs, alongside lottery funding through the BFI, are a catalyst for creativity and innovation in storytelling in UK independent film, and are a key ingredient in the UK’s winning combination of outstanding talent and skills, world-leading studios and facilities, and iconic locations, which attracts film production from around the world.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Adrian Wootton, chief executive of the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.britishfilmcommission.org.uk/"">British Film Commission</a>, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>The UK’s creative sector tax reliefs have been a tremendous success, attracting inward investment through film, television and animation while stimulating growth in jobs and infrastructure across the UK, from London, Bristol and Manchester to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The boost they give our domestic screen industries is crucial, since the money generated by major inward investment titles helps create further training and business opportunities which allow our own independent productions to thrive, thus maintaining the UK’s status as a cultural powerhouse that is both creative and highly profitable.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Independent UK productions of all budgets have benefited from the film tax relief, receiving a third of total government support.</p><br/><br/><p>The UK film industry’s cutting edge skills in the fields of visual effects, sound production and world-class studios are making the UK an even more attractive place to make films. For example, the UK is home to many of the world’s leading VFX companies including those behind award-winning films such as Gravity.</p><br/><br/><p>As well as its creative and technology companies, the film industry relies upon a variety of sectors from catering to security, who have also felt the positive effects of the tax relief. BFI figures show that film production supports around 40,000 full-time jobs in the UK, which is a 22% increase from 2009.</p><br/><br/><p>Introduced in 2007, the film tax relief was extended to 25% for films of all budget levels on 1 April 2015 to support UK film making. The relief is available to films which qualify as British productions through a cultural test or via an official UK co-production treaty.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""key-facts-and-further-information"">Key facts and further information</h2><br/><br/><p>Based on UK expenditure from films which qualified for tax relief, there was an increase of 25% in industry investment into our creative economy in comparison to 2014. UK expenditure from films which qualified for tax relief (final or interim certification for film tax relief) went from £1.297 billion in 2012 to 2013 to £1.627 billion in 2014 to 2015.</p><br/><br/><p>Inward investment has allowed greater collaboration between US production companies and UK films. Recent James Bond box-office smash Spectre was a UK produced – US financed film shot around the world, and across the UK, which is expected to be amongst the highest grossing films of 2015.</p><br/><br/><p>Other upcoming inward investment releases will include Eddie Redmayne’s venture into JK Rowling world of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the live action version of Beauty and the Beast and Knights of the Round Table: King Arthur. Plus Star Wars: Episode VIII, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Untitled Matt Damon/Bourne Sequel, The Jungle Book, The Lost City of Z, The Huntsman: Winter’s War.</p><br/><br/><p>The billion dollar Star Wars franchise is committed to making the new trilogy here in the UK and in addition to filming has set up a new Visual FX facility house.</p><br/><br/><p>Pinewood have since announced a £200 million expansion to double the size of its existing studios adding new stages, workshops and production offices to accommodate growing demand for UK productions.</p><br/><br/><p>Suffragette has been a success at the UK box office. An independent British film, it premiered in the UK as the opening film at the BFI London Film Festival. Suffragette was shot over 47 days with a crew of 181. The production also provided job development roles for 15 trainees as well as using hundreds of extras.</p><br/><br/><p>Tom Hardy starring in Legend has surpassed animated favourite Shaun the Sheep to take the title of highest grossing UK independent film for 2015.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""regional-impact-of-the-independent-film-and-animation-industry"">Regional impact of the independent film and animation industry</h2><br/><br/><h3 id=""west-midlands"">West Midlands</h3><br/><p>She Who Brings Gifts was written and directed by first time feature filmmaker Colm McCarthy (who has been critically acclaimed for the hit TV show Peaky Blinders). The film was shot over 36 days employing crew from across the Birmingham area.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""yorkshire"">Yorkshire</h3><br/><p>Yorkshire has quickly grown to be a major film and television production base in the UK and has seen an incredibly busy year. More than six new titles started filming, including an adaptation of Swallows &amp; Amazons.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""northern-ireland"">Northern Ireland</h3><br/><p>Major independent film High-Rise was filmed in Belfast and Bangor over seven weeks last year with a crew of 197 people and job development opportunities for three trainees.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""wales"">Wales</h3><br/><p>There has been substantial growth in production companies getting feature film, animation and documentary film projects started in Wales including Ethel &amp; Ernest, an animation with Lupus Films in London and Cloth Cat animation studio in Cardiff Bay.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""scotland"">Scotland</h3><br/><p>A grassroots production of the classic Scottish novel, Sunset Song by Lewis Grassic Gibbon, was finally brought to the big screen by the British filmmaker, Terence Davies. The UK co-production stars British actress Agyness Deyn, Peter Mullan and Kevin Guthrie. Backed by the BFI with Creative Scotland, the Luxembourg Film Fund and BBC Scotland, filming lasted for 37 days working a crew of 240 people.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""london"">London</h3><br/><p>Suffragette was the first feature film to shoot in the Palace of Westminster. It also left a lasting impact a derelict building in Harpenden made safe during filming, has now been converted into a sports venue for the local community.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""business-impact-since-april-2015"">Business Impact since April 2015</h2><br/><br/><h3 id=""union-vfx"">Union VFX</h3><br/><p>The visual effects company set up in 2008 by Tim Caplan and Adam Gascoyne has grown in size, workload and reputation over the past eight years. It has worked on major feature films including The Theory of Everything, Philomena and The Woman in Black. As a result of its expansion it has moved to bigger premises and over this past year has worked on Suffragette, Far From the Madding Crowd, Everest, Genius and The Lady in the Van.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""above-the-line"">Above the Line</h3><br/><p>A set assistance and security business offers nationwide support for productions, providing specialist security officers and set and location assistants. Having only founded in 2011, in four years it has seen its business grow by over 300%.</p><br/><br/><p>Most recently it has been working on film productions including Pan and Kingsman: The Secret Service as well as Downton Abbey and Poldark.</p><br/><br/><p>Managing director of Above the Line, Daniel O’Toole, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>Our business has grown phenomenally in a relatively short amount of time, and I can see the potential for us to expand further geographically across the UK.</p><br/><br/>  <p>I am also proud to say that we have been able to create training programmes for our staff and job opportunities for young people as well as experienced workers - at our busiest times we have 200+ people working.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The film and television tax reliefs have been good for the industry and in turn helping to build our business creating employment and value for the economy.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><div class=""call-to-action""><br/><p>Access <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-films-certified-british-through-cultural-test-for-film-2015-11.xls"">the full list of certified films</a> from the BFI.</p><br/></div><br/><br/></div></p>",

There is no need to give personal details, and information that leads directly to an arrest could be considered for a small reward.</p><br/><br/><p>McGowan, 61, originally from Edinburgh, was arrested at a swimming pool in Valencia on 10 August by the Guardia Civil. He fled the UK 12 years ago after being found guilty of smuggling 28.3 million cigarettes into the country. His crimes robbed the UK of around £4 million in duty and he was sentenced in his absence in December 2001.</p><br/><br/><p>McGowan was part of a wider conspiracy to smuggle around 56 million cigarettes into the UK between November 1999 and March 2000. Ten other men were involved in the plot, which robbed the UK taxpayer of over £8.2 million.</p><br/><br/><p>Adrian Farley, Assistant Director of Criminal Investigation for HM Revenue &amp; Customs, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">McGowan is finally facing UK justice after 12 years on the run.

HMRC would like to thank the Spanish authorities and UK organisations that assisted with this operation.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>The call to ring 900 988 922 comes as smugglers try to make huge profits from illegal imports of cigarettes, and the selling of low-quality, counterfeit cigarettes, tobacco and alcohol.</p><br/><br/><p>Customs officers are also keen for information about other items such as drugs, firearms, obscene material and endangered species. Tax frauds that HMRC want to hear about include betting and gaming, money laundering and the ‘carousel’ VAT scam in Europe.</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Smugglers and fraudsters cheat the rest of us by not contributing the tax that pays for schools, hospitals and public services”, said an HMRC spokesman.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">People in the British expatriate community can help us to find them.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/></div></p>",

The government’s film tax relief generates almost £12.50 for every £1 spent and provides crucial support for UK films and filmmakers – it is a shrewd investment for the UK.</p><br/><br/>  <p>Britain’s film and creative industries give us much to be proud of, with British stories as diverse as Spectre and Suffragette winning the hearts and minds of audiences across the world while creating jobs and investment at home.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The creative sector tax reliefs, alongside lottery funding through the BFI, are a catalyst for creativity and innovation in storytelling in UK independent film, and are a key ingredient in the UK’s winning combination of outstanding talent and skills, world-leading studios and facilities, and iconic locations, which attracts film production from around the world.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Adrian Wootton, chief executive of the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.britishfilmcommission.org.uk/"">British Film Commission</a>, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>The UK’s creative sector tax reliefs have been a tremendous success, attracting inward investment through film, television and animation while stimulating growth in jobs and infrastructure across the UK, from London, Bristol and Manchester to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The boost they give our domestic screen industries is crucial, since the money generated by major inward investment titles helps create further training and business opportunities which allow our own independent productions to thrive, thus maintaining the UK’s status as a cultural powerhouse that is both creative and highly profitable.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Independent UK productions of all budgets have benefited from the film tax relief, receiving a third of total government support.</p><br/><br/><p>The UK film industry’s cutting edge skills in the fields of visual effects, sound production and world-class studios are making the UK an even more attractive place to make films. For example, the UK is home to many of the world’s leading VFX companies including those behind award-winning films such as Gravity.</p><br/><br/><p>As well as its creative and technology companies, the film industry relies upon a variety of sectors from catering to security, who have also felt the positive effects of the tax relief. BFI figures show that film production supports around 40,000 full-time jobs in the UK, which is a 22% increase from 2009.</p><br/><br/><p>Introduced in 2007, the film tax relief was extended to 25% for films of all budget levels on 1 April 2015 to support UK film making. The relief is available to films which qualify as British productions through a cultural test or via an official UK co-production treaty.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""key-facts-and-further-information"">Key facts and further information</h2><br/><br/><p>Based on UK expenditure from films which qualified for tax relief, there was an increase of 25% in industry investment into our creative economy in comparison to 2014. UK expenditure from films which qualified for tax relief (final or interim certification for film tax relief) went from £1.297 billion in 2012 to 2013 to £1.627 billion in 2014 to 2015.</p><br/><br/><p>Inward investment has allowed greater collaboration between US production companies and UK films. Recent James Bond box-office smash Spectre was a UK produced – US financed film shot around the world, and across the UK, which is expected to be amongst the highest grossing films of 2015.</p><br/><br/><p>Other upcoming inward investment releases will include Eddie Redmayne’s venture into JK Rowling world of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the live action version of Beauty and the Beast and Knights of the Round Table: King Arthur. Plus Star Wars: Episode VIII, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Untitled Matt Damon/Bourne Sequel, The Jungle Book, The Lost City of Z, The Huntsman: Winter’s War.</p><br/><br/><p>The billion dollar Star Wars franchise is committed to making the new trilogy here in the UK and in addition to filming has set up a new Visual FX facility house.</p><br/><br/><p>Pinewood have since announced a £200 million expansion to double the size of its existing studios adding new stages, workshops and production offices to accommodate growing demand for UK productions.</p><br/><br/><p>Suffragette has been a success at the UK box office.

Commodities sometimes used as animal feed</h2><br/><br/><h3 id=""meat-offal-and-similar-abattoir-products"">9.1 Meat, offal and similar abattoir products</h3><br/><br/><p>Most meat, offal and similar products from abattoirs which are for use in animal feeds are zero-rated.</p><br/><br/><p>Abattoir products are standard-rated if they:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>are held out for sale for a non-feeding purpose, for example blood for fertiliser (normally recognisable by declaration of nitrogen or phosphoric acid content)</li><br/>  <li>are used solely for a non-feeding purpose, for example hair, horns, hoofs, manure</li><br/>  <li>are held out for sale as pet food and are packaged or prepared (see sections <a href=""#sect6"">6</a> and <a href=""#sect7"">7</a>)</li><br/>  <li>have undergone some further preparation beyond mincing and dicing, which would specialise the products to the pet food market (see <a href=""#sect74"">paragraph 7.4</a>)</li><br/>  <li>are used exclusively in the preparation of pharmaceutical products, for example gall bags, glands, ovaries, and placenta</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Greaves supplied in pieces of a size suitable for feeding to pets are also standard-rated.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""dead-animals"">9.2 Dead animals</h3><br/><br/><p>Dead mice, rats and day old chicks sold for feeding to ‘exotic’ pets such as reptiles may be zero-rated unless they’re specifically prepared or canned or otherwise packaged as pet food.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""oils-and-fats"">9.3 Oils and fats</h3><br/><br/><p>Oils and fats (including tallows) of a kind suitable for use in animal feeding stuffs are zero-rated unless they:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>require further processing before becoming suitable for inclusion in animal feeds</li><br/>  <li>are held out for sale for a non-feed purpose</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Waste oil from fish and chip shops generally requires processing before it can be used as an animal feed ingredient, and is therefore usually standard-rated. But, a need only for sieving, decanting or heating does not disqualify the oil from zero rating.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""para9-4"">9.4 Medicinal products and feeding stuffs containing medicines</h3><br/><br/><p>Medicines are not covered by the zero rate even where they’re administered in an animal’s feed.</p><br/><br/><p>Some feeding stuffs incorporate medicines and the VAT liability is determined by the basic nature of the product. A product is zero-rated only if the addition of medicinal substances does not alter the essential nature of the product as a feeding stuff. As a general guideline, a product is standard-rated if it’s the subject of a product licence or marketing authorisation issued by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p><br/><br/><p>Veterinary medicines supplied to certain charities may be eligible for zero rating under a different relief, see <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-vat-affects-charities-notice-7011"">How VAT affects charities (Notice 701/1)</a>.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""para9-5"">9.5 Straw</h3><br/><br/><p>Under an agreement with the main trade associations, ‘held out for sale for non-food use’ includes supplies to customers known to be:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>market gardeners or other horticultural concerns which will obviously be buying the straw for use as composting material</li><br/>  <li>industrial packers or other non-agricultural businesses (such as a brickworks) where the straw will obviously be used as packing material</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Supplies to these customers will be standard-rated.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""grass-and-grazing-rights"">9.6 Grass and grazing rights</h3><br/><br/><p>If you supply grazing rights for horses, sheep or any other grazing animals the supply is zero-rated as animal feed. But where grazing or other food forms part of a supply of care of an animal or group of animals, see <a href=""#sect10"">section 10</a>.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""examples-of-commodities-usually-zero-rated"">9.7 Examples of commodities usually zero-rated</h3><br/><br/><p>The following are zero-rated unless they’re sold for a non-food purpose, held out for sale as packaged or prepared pet food or are packaged as food for wild birds:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>cereal and cereal by-products including bran, sharps and similar residues</li><br/>  <li>feed blocks</li><br/>  <li>fish meal and fish residue meal</li><br/>  <li>forage crops</li><br/>  <li>ground oyster shell</li><br/>  <li>hay and straw, see <a href=""#para9-5"">paragraph 9.5</a><br/></li><br/>  <li>hay and straw molasses</li><br/>  <li>oilseed residue (except castor oil)</li><br/>  <li>peanuts</li><br/>  <li>rabbit food</li><br/>  <li>specialised diets formulated specifically for laboratory animals</li><br/>  <li>specialised diets formulated specifically for racing greyhounds (other than biscuit or meal)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""examples-of-commodities-usually-standard-rated"">9.8 Examples of commodities usually standard-rated</h3><br/><br/><p>Examples are:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>drugs, but see <a href=""#para9-4"">paragraph 9.4</a><br/></li><br/>  <li>single chemicals and minerals, other than salt, even when fed direct to animals</li><br/>  <li>thatching material (for example Norfolk reed, wheat reed, or straw reed)</li><br/>  <li>urea (unless specifically held out for sale for animal feeding purposes)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""sect10"">10. Livery and other care packages</h2><br/><br/><h3 id=""keep-of-animals"">10.1 Keep of animals</h3><br/><br/><p>The supply of the keep of animals is generally standard-rated, but see paragraph 10.3. Even if you supply animal feed as part of the service of care, the full consideration for your service is standard-rated. The feed element cannot be treated as a separate zero-rated supply.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""stabling"">10.2 Stabling</h3><br/><br/><p>If you allow an owner exclusive use of stabling (that is you allocate all or an identifiable part of the stabling for the sole use of his animals) this is either an exempt supply of a right over land or standard-rated if you exercise the ‘option to tax’, see <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-742-land-and-property"">VAT Notice 742: land and property</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>You may zero rate separate supplies of feed (either as general feed or in the form of grazing rights) only when no element of care is supplied.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""livery-services"">10.3 Livery services</h3><br/><br/><p>These are services provided for horses in a stable that go beyond the right to occupy the stable.</p><br/><br/><p>They may include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>feeding or turning the animal out to graze</li><br/>  <li>mucking out, spreading straw or other bedding</li><br/>  <li>worming and clipping</li><br/>  <li>grooming and plaiting</li><br/>  <li>taking on any responsibility for the welfare of the animal, including arranging for veterinary treatment</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>They do not include those clearly identifiable separate supplies such as veterinary services.</p><br/><br/><p>You must standard rate the supply of livery services, including any food provided, unless the stabling is an exempt right over land, see paragraph 10.2, which you have not opted to tax.</p><br/><br/><p>If the supply of stabling is a right over land and you have not opted to tax it, the whole livery package is exempt unless it is provided by a special purpose stable. Livery packages provided by special purpose stables (such as race horse trainers, stud farms and stables involved in schooling horses or breaking them in) are standard-rated.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""your-rights-and-obligations"">Your rights and obligations</h2><br/><br/><p>Read <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/your-charter"">Your Charter</a> to find out what you can expect from HMRC and what we expect from you.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""help-us-improve-this-notice"">Help us improve this notice</h2><br/><br/><p>If you have any feedback about this notice please email: <a href=""mailto:customerexperience.indirecttaxes@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk"">customerexperience.indirecttaxes@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>You’ll need to include the full title of this notice.
