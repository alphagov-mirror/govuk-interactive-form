Our idea of who is vulnerable may not be correct. It made me think that the same is sometimes true of suicide risk.</p><br/><br/><p>In England, men are three times more likely to die by suicide than women, and most suicides are in men under 50. The risk is so pervasive that <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.samaritans.org/news/wspd-stigma-main-barrier-men-seeking-help"">Samaritans</a> and the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.thecalmzone.net"">Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM)</a> are both running campaigns to help men at risk. While every suicide is a tragedy and a shock, some come without warning, leaving family and friends bewildered.</p><br/><br/><p>Signs of suicide risk are often unclear: they may be oblique, ambiguous and difficult to interpret. Some people facing a suicidal crisis may not appear obviously distressed. Others will show changes in behaviour, but perhaps not what people around them expect to see. Teenagers may become withdrawn, spending increasing amounts of time alone in their rooms, perhaps online. Men may become irritable or drink more than usual.</p><br/><br/><p>Vigilance when men we know are facing problems can be vital, even when they look as if they are coping, like the men in the Grand Canyon posters. It is usually a combination of factors that lead to suicide - debt, living alone, bereavement, bullying and family breakdown can all play a part. Often the final trigger does not look too serious on its own but against a background of other problems it can be hard to bear.</p><br/><br/><p>Even when it is clear to relatives and friends that something is seriously wrong, they may be afraid to intervene in case they make matters worse, damage their relationship or even increase the risk of suicide. While asking about suicide can be uncomfortable, it may save a life. And asking about suicide will never put the idea into a person’s head - they may well be relieved that someone realises how bad they feel.</p><br/><br/><p>Although suicide and attempted suicide were decriminalised in 1961, the stigma surrounding the subject can discourage people from talking about suicidal thoughts. Some fear they will be labelled as weak, sinful or selfish if they own up to thinking about suicide - and being afraid or ashamed to talk about it may deter them from seeking the treatment they need. This is why the theme for this year’s <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.iasp.info/wspd/"">World Suicide Prevention Day</a> on September 10 is <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.samaritans.org/news/wspd-stigma-main-barrier-men-seeking-help"">Stigma: A Major Barrier for Suicide Prevention.</a></p><br/><br/><p>Suicide is the leading cause of death in young men but we can all play a part in bringing the tragic figures down. So be alert if someone you know is going through a difficult time, remember you can save a life by asking the difficult question about suicide. And don’t be convinced that they are fine even if they say they are.</p><br/><br/><p>In 2012 on World Suicide Prevention Day the Department of Health published the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/suicide-prevention-strategy-for-england"">‘Suicide Prevention Strategy for England’</a></p><br/></div></p>",

A jury at Isleworth Crown Court  found him guilty on Friday 2 March.</p><br/><br/><p>Deputy Director Jim Jarvie, from the UK Border Agency’s Criminal and Financial Investigation team, said: ‘Adeniji was clearly a significant figure at the centre of an extensive criminal network. He was involved in the importation and distribution of class A drugs on a grand scale.</p><br/><br/><p>‘Although the true amount of drugs he smuggled into the UK will never be known, it is probably safe to assume he has been responsible for the importation of tens - if not hundreds - of millions of pounds worth.’</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""deals"">Deals</h3><br/><br/><p>The flat in Kilburn was the hub of Adeniji’s criminal business, the place where he stored the drugs that he, and probably others who worked with him, had smuggled into the UK.</p><br/><br/><p>He would then use a room in a nearby hotel in Maida Vale or rented apartment to do his drugs deals. Text messages were found inviting others to the hotel, and these matched his pattern of travel to Amsterdam.</p><br/><br/><p>Since Adeniji’s arrest assets of between £500,000 and £1,000,000 have been frozen by UK Border Agency investigators. They will now be the subject of Proceeds of Crime Act confiscation proceedings.</p><br/><br/><p><a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;username=xa-4d62945115adca0b"">Share</a></p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/></div></p>",

The majority of people (80%) infected with Zika virus will not experience any symptoms - for those who do, the symptoms are mild fever, rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue.</p><br/><br/><p>Zika poses a greater risk if you are pregnant or planning to have a baby and can have very serious consequences for the unborn child, potentially resulting in deformities and stunted growth of the head.</p><br/><br/><p>With a month to go before the Rio Olympic Games start, Chief Medical Officer Professor Dame Sally Davies sets out the official health advice regarding the Zika virus.</p><br/><br/><div class=""call-to-action""><br/><h2 id=""top-tips"">Top tips</h2><br/><br/><h3 id=""section"">1</h3><br/><br/><p>Apply insect repellent during the day - you can take liquids of up to 100ml with you into the Olympic venues, the same size you can take through airport security, and you should also apply sunscreen before repellent.<br/>Choose an insect repellent high in either DEET (with up to 50% DEET content if you are pregnant), Picaridin or PMD concentration (all active ingredients in insect repellent) and pack enough to last your entire trip – your chosen brand may not be available in Brazil.  For more detailed advice, see PHE’s guidance on mosquito bite avoidance.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""section-1"">2</h3><br/><br/><p>Wear loose fitting long sleeved tops and trousers. Zika-carrying mosquitoes bite during the daytime, so it helps to wear loose fitting clothing during the day as well as insect repellent.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""section-2"">3</h3><br/><br/><p>To avoid the small risk of sexual transmission of the Zika virus and prevent potential complications of infection during pregnancy, couples should use condoms while at the Olympics and for 8 weeks after you get back. <br/>If you or your partner are planning on becoming pregnant, there is further advice on condom use on the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/zika-virus-updated-travel-advice-for-pregnant-women"">Public Health England website</a>.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""section-3"">4</h3><br/><br/><p>If you experience Zika symptoms in Brazil, seek medical advice at the earliest opportunity. The typical symptoms of Zika virus usually last 2-7 days and include mild fever, rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue. There is currently no specific treatment or vaccine for Zika virus and if you feel unwell you should rest, drink plenty of fluids and take paracetamol to treat fever or pain if necessary. If you experience symptoms on your return to the UK, you should see your GP.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""section-4"">5</h3><br/><br/><p>Visit your GP/practice nurse or a travel clinic before you go to check if you need any further vaccinations and medication and, as always when travelling abroad, you must have the right travel insurance.</p><br/></div><br/><br/><p>Professor Dame Sally Davies said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>Everyone should enjoy the Games in Rio to the fullest. But, as with any Zika affected area, you should make sure you protect yourself by using a good insect repellent high in the ingredients DEET or Picardin - this is marked on the packaging. Buy it before you go, apply it before you get to your venue, be aware of the time before effectiveness fades, and wear loose-fitting long-sleeved tops and trousers. You should take extra care as the mosquitoes bite during the day and the night.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">If you are pregnant, my advice is to postpone travel if possible, but if you have to go, visit your doctor first so they can give you all the advice you need for the trip. If you do travel, use condoms during sex for the rest of your pregnancy. All people should use condoms during sex while at the Olympics and for 8 weeks after they get back.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>There is more advice on <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mosquito-bite-avoidance-for-travellers"">avoiding mosquito bites</a> from Public Health England.</p><br/><br/><p>You can also <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/stay-ahead-of-the-games--2"">stay ahead of the games</a> and download a <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/458817/FCO_SAOTG_Checklist.pdf"">travel checklist</a>.</p><br/></div></p>",

Their conclusion on e-cigarette safety also finds that based on the available evidence ‘e-cigarettes are likely to be far less harmful than combustible tobacco cigarettes.’</p><br/><br/><p>Professor John Newton, Director for Health Improvement at <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>Every minute someone is admitted to hospital from smoking, with around 79,000 deaths a year in England alone.</p><br/><br/>  <p>Our new review reinforces the finding that vaping is a fraction of the risk of smoking, at least 95% less harmful, and of negligible risk to bystanders. Yet over half of smokers either falsely believe that vaping is as harmful as smoking or just don’t know.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">It would be tragic if thousands of smokers who could quit with the help of an e-cigarette are being put off due to false fears about their safety.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Professor Ann McNeill, lead author and Professor of Tobacco Addiction at King’s College London said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>It’s of great concern that smokers still have such a poor understanding about what causes the harm from smoking. When people smoke tobacco cigarettes, they inhale a lethal mix of 7,000 smoke constituents, 70 of which are known to cause cancer.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">People smoke for the nicotine, but contrary to what the vast majority believe, nicotine causes little if any of the harm. The toxic smoke is the culprit and is the overwhelming cause of all the tobacco-related disease and death. There are now a greater variety of alternative ways of getting nicotine than ever before, including nicotine gum, nasal spray, lozenges and e-cigarettes.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Professor Linda Bauld, author and Professor of Health Policy, University of Stirling and Chair in Behavioural Research for Cancer Prevention, Cancer Research UK said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Concern has been expressed that e-cigarette use will lead young people into smoking. But in the UK, research clearly shows that regular use of e-cigarettes among young people who have never smoked remains negligible, less than 1%, and youth smoking continues to decline at an encouraging rate. We need to keep closely monitoring these trends, but so far the data suggest that e-cigarettes are not acting as a route into regular smoking amongst young people.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> is calling on smokers and a number of bodies to act on the evidence.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""smokers"">Smokers</h2><br/><br/><p>Anyone who has struggled to quit should try switching to an e-cigarette and get professional help. The greatest quit success is among those who combine using an e-cigarette with support from a local stop smoking service.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""local-stop-smoking-services-and-healthcare-professionals"">Local stop smoking services and healthcare professionals</h2><br/><br/><p>These should provide behavioural support to those smokers wanting to quit with the help of an e-cigarette. A new training course on e-cigarettes for healthcare professionals by the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training is now live.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency-mhra"">Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title=""Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency"">MHRA</abbr>)</h2><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency"">MHRA</abbr> continue their work in regulating and licensing e-cigarette products and support manufacturers to expedite the licensing of e-cigarettes as medicinal quit aids. <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> believes there is compelling evidence that e-cigarettes be made available to NHS patients.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""nhs-trusts"">NHS Trusts</h2><br/><br/><p>To become truly smokefree, Trusts should ensure</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>e-cigarettes, alongside nicotine replacement therapies are available for sale in hospital shops</li><br/>  <li>vaping policies support smokers to quit and stay smokefree</li><br/>  <li>smoking shelters be removed</li><br/>  <li>frontline staff take every opportunity to encourage and support patients to quit</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>The government’s new Tobacco Control Plan for England includes a commitment to ‘maximise the availability of safer alternatives to smoking’.

This advice will be kept under review and updated as more information becomes available.</p><br/><br/>  <p>We expect to see small numbers of Zika virus infections in travellers returning to the UK, but the risk to the wider population is negligible as the mosquito vector is not found in the UK. The symptoms of can be similar to other mosquito-borne infections such as dengue, chikungunya and malaria so laboratory testing is essential for the correct diagnosis. If you have recently returned from an area where Zika virus transmissions are currently reported and have a fever or flu-like illness, seek medical attention without delay to exclude malaria and mention your travel history.</p><br/><br/>  <p>Zika virus is related to dengue virus. The virus is spread by the Aedes mosquito, which predominantly bites during the day. The illness is similar to dengue and chikungunya and is generally mild and self-limiting, lasting 2 to 7 days.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Symptoms of Zika virus infection may include fever, joint pain, rash, conjunctivitis/red eyes, headache, muscle pain and eye pain. No specific anti-viral treatment is available for Zika virus infection.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>For more information about Zika virus refer to the PHE or <a rel=""external"" href=""http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/diseases/zikavirus/""><abbr title=""National Travel Health Network and Centre"">NaTHNaC</abbr></a> websites.</p><br/><br/></div></p>",

Just because you have green phlegm or snot does not you mean you necessarily need antibiotics.</p><br/><br/><p>This advice is issued ahead of Self-Care Week (18 to 24 November 2013) which aims to help people take care of themselves, and lets them know what’s available to help them look after their health. Monday 18 November marks European Antibiotics Awareness Day which aims to raise awareness of the risks associated with the inappropriate use of antibiotics and how to use them responsibly.</p><br/><br/><p>People tend to believe that coughs and colds will get better more quickly with antibiotics if they have green phlegm or snot rather than clear phlegm or snot because they see green phlegm as a sign of infection. However, snot and phlegm of any colour is produced by the body as a defence mechanism against dirt, pollen or microbes and as such, is not always a sign of infection. If the body is actually under attack from microbes the immune system is very capable of fighting infections and does not always need medications, including antibiotics, to do it.</p><br/><br/><p>The main reasons why patients visit their <abbr title=""General practitioner (family doctor)"">GP</abbr> is when their day-to-day activities or sleeping are affected by their illness or if their illness goes on longer than expected.</p><br/><br/><p>Here are the typical symptoms of common infections and what can be done to ease them.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""symptom-a-sore-or-irritated-throat"">Symptom: a sore or irritated throat</h3><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Pain killers: painkillers help to relieve symptoms of sore throat, fever, and headaches in adults. Use what suits you best and talk to your pharmacist if you’re unsure.</li><br/>  <li>Home remedies: you may be able to relieve symptoms of a sore throat by eating cool, soft food and drinking cool or warm drinks, as well as sucking lozenges, ice cubes, ice lollies or hard sweets.</li><br/>  <li>Smoking: avoid smoking and smoky environments as much as you can.</li><br/>  <li>Fluids: drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of fluid (preferably water) every day, particularly if you also have a fever.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""symptom-coughing-with-or-without-phlegm-or-a-hoarse-voice"">Symptom: coughing with or without phlegm or a hoarse voice</h3><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Home remedies: you can try simple home remedies, such as ‘honey and lemon’ – just add freshly squeezed juice from one lemon and a teaspoon of honey to a mug of hot water. Drink at least 6 to 9 glasses of water in a day and suck lozenges.</li><br/>  <li>Cough mixtures: there is little evidence to say whether over the counter medicines are effective for relieving cough symptoms. Despite the lack of research evidence, you may still get some benefit from over the counter preparations – speak to your pharmacist.</li><br/>  <li>Paracetamol: paracetamol can help with relieving symptoms that may accompany a cough, such as a sore throat, fevers, and not feeling well.</li><br/>  <li>If you have a dry cough, try not to cough: although this may be easier said than done, you may be able to cough less often by trying not to cough, because our desire to cough can sometimes be influenced by our brain.</li><br/>  <li>Stop smoking: smoking is one of the commonest reasons for a chronic cough. Stopping smoking – or at least smoking less –may improve your cough, but also benefits your health in other ways (reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke, and lung cancer, for example).</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""symptom-fever-in-a-child"">Symptom: fever in a child</h3><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Check your child’s temperature: in children aged between four weeks and five years, use either an electronic or chemical dot thermometer in your child’s arm pit, or an infra-red tympanic thermometer in the ear canal. If you haven’t got a thermometer, use your judgement as to whether your child feels abnormally hot.</li><br/>  <li>Clothing: avoid over- or under-dressing your feverish child.</li><br/>  <li>Heating and cooling: keep your central heating down. Tepid sponging of children is no longer recommended.</li><br/>  <li>Fluids: offer your child regular fluids. If you’re a breastfeeding mother, offer your child as many feeds as she/he will take.</li><br/>  <li>Medication: you can give either paracetamol OR ibuprofen (not both) if your child is unwell or appears distressed.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""symptom-blocked-nose-caused-by-a-build-up-of-phlegm-or-mucus"">Symptom: blocked nose caused by a build up of phlegm or mucus</h3><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Nasal saline drops: nasal drops may be useful as steam inhalation is not advised</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""symptom-sneezing"">Symptom: sneezing</h3><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Decongestants: either oral or nasal and these are available from your chemist.</li><br/>  <li>Over-the-counter cold remedies: over-the-counter cold remedies will help to reduce sneezing and runny noses.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""symptom-a-runny-nose-with-snot-of-any-colour-or-nasal-pain-and-irritation-or-blocked-sinuses"">Symptom: a runny nose with snot of any colour or nasal pain and irritation or blocked sinuses</h3><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Decongestants: speak to your local pharmacist</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""symptom-a-general-sense-of-feeling-unwell"">Symptom: a general sense of feeling unwell</h3><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Rest and sleep</li><br/>  <li>Pain killers: painkillers help to relieve symptoms of muscle aches,sore throat, fever, and headaches in adults.

Unfortunately antibiotics will not always help with recovering from these viral illnesses and taking them when you don’t need them feeds into the cycle of antibiotic resistance which means they may not work when you really need them to.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>With most respiratory infections it is a case of being patient, managing the symptoms with readily available medications and waiting for the infection to clear naturally from the body which can take three to four weeks.</p><br/><br/>  <p>There are many medications and ways of managing colds and flu so if you have the classic symptoms of a sore throat, cough and are sneezing then speak to your local chemist about ways to make yourself feel more comfortable.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Many people have a good understanding of what antibiotic resistance is but when it comes to their own illnesses still believe that antibiotics can help to treat what can be severe cold and flu symptoms. This is not the case and we must get away from believing this to preserve these precious medicines for when we really need them.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Dr Maureen Baker, Chair of the <abbr title=""Royal College of General Practitioners"">RCGP</abbr>, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>Antibiotics can achieve excellent results if prescribed and used appropriately but patients need to be more aware of their drawbacks - and of the many common conditions that antibiotics will not help.</p><br/><br/>  <p>Many patients have come to expect antibiotics for common colds and infections that will get better naturally or respond better to other treatments, such as over-the-counter medication from pharmacies, closely managing fluid intake and body temperature, and avoiding smoky environments, all of which can be easily managed by the patient.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">If antibiotics are used irresponsibly it can lead to longer, more expensive stays in hospital for people with more serious drug-resistant infections.

The overall result is that children consume 3 times more sugar than is recommended.</p><br/><br/><p>The new Change4Life campaign encourages parents to look for ‘100 calorie snacks, two a day max’ to help them purchase healthier snacks than the ones they currently buy.</p><br/><br/><p>Selected supermarkets are supporting the campaign. As part of their wider work promoting good health, Tesco will help parents -  instore and online - choose affordable, healthier snacks that are 100 calories or less. Co-op will also provide tasty and healthy snacking products, making it easier for customers to make healthier choices on the go.</p><br/><br/><p>Parents can also get money-off vouchers from Change4Life to help them try healthier snack options, including malt loaf, lower-sugar fromage frais, and drinks with no added sugar.</p><br/><br/><p>Many of the unhealthy snacks children consume regularly are high in sugar and also typically high in calories, for example:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>an ice-cream contains around 175 calories</li><br/>  <li>a pack of crisps contains around 190 calories</li><br/>  <li>a chocolate bar contains around 200 calories</li><br/>  <li>a pastry contains around 270 calories</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>The ‘100 calorie snacks, two a day max’ tip applies to all snacks apart from fruit and vegetables, as children should also be encouraged to eat a variety of these to achieve their 5 A Day.</p><br/><br/><p>Dr Alison Tedstone, Chief Nutritionist at Public Health England, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>The true extent of children’s snacking habits is greater than the odd biscuit or chocolate bar. Children are having unhealthy snacks throughout the day and parents have told us they’re concerned.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">To make it easier for busy families, we’ve developed a simple rule of thumb to help them move towards healthier snacking – look for 100 calories snacks, two a day max.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Justine Roberts, CEO and founder of Mumsnet, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>The volume of sugar kids are getting from snacks and sugary drinks alone is pretty mind-blowing, and it can often be difficult to distinguish which snacks are healthy and which aren’t.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">This rule of thumb from Change4Life will help parents make healthier choices, which can only be a good thing.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr>’s improved Change4Life ‘Food Scanner’ app also shows parents how many calories, sugar, salt and saturated fat is in their food to help make healthier choices easier. It can be downloaded from the App Store or Google Play.</p><br/><br/><p>With a third of children leaving primary school overweight or obese, tackling obesity requires wider action and is not just limited to individual efforts from parents. <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> is working with the food industry to cut 20% of sugar from the products children consume most by 2020, with work to reduce calories due to start in 2018.</p><br/><br/></div></p>",

It is evidence-based and leads to long term behaviour change by creating a social norm around walking and cycling.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""what-was-involved"">What was involved</h2><br/><br/><p>Beat the Street was created by Intelligent Health, a company dedicated to building active communities in the UK and worldwide. The programme adopts a community approach to behaviour change that is split into 3 phases: anticipation, experience and legacy.</p><br/><br/><p>Dr William Bird, CEO and founder of Intelligent Health who developed Beat the Street, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">If we want to improve the health and wellbeing of the country we need to be ambitious, provide a clear narrative to get people active and support them on their journey. Physical activity has more health benefits than any other single intervention and is the means to a healthy community.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>The first 3 months are spent building anticipation of the project. This involves engaging with stakeholders and communities to create champions, teams and generate excitement about the game. Knowledge is gathered on suitable walking and cycling routes, local events and amenities in order to produce a safe, effective game for the community to enjoy and feel part of.</p><br/><br/><p>The main Beat the Street experience lasts for up to 2 months and transforms a town into a giant playground.</p><br/><br/><p>Participants can pick up a Beat the Street card which contains radio-frequency identification (<abbr title=""radio-frequency identification"">RFID</abbr>) technology and tap them against sensors called ‘Beat Boxes’ located on lamp posts across the area. Players receive points for each box they tap and can even create or join teams which can receive prizes for tapping the most boxes; this motivates entire schools, community groups and businesses into becoming more active.</p><br/><br/><p>Once the game is complete, Beat the Street creates a legacy of physical activity; using the power and popularity of the game, Beat the Street will signpost people to events and activities in their area as well as working with local stakeholders to continue to build active communities.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""what-works-well"">What works well</h2><br/><br/><p>Beat the Street projects deliver meaningful changes in population physical activity levels with more than <br/>200,000 people participating in 2016 so far.</p><br/><br/><p>On average, across all Beat the Street projects, the proportion of people meeting the physical activity guidelines increased from 40% to 50%. In 2015, 1 out of every 7 adults said they were inactive at the start of Beat the Street. By the end of Beat the Street, 78% of these people reported that they had become more active. After about 6 months, we estimate that about half of the people who became more active continued to be more active.</p><br/><br/><p>When people were asked about the main benefits they derive from taking part in Beat the Street, ‘having fun’ and ‘exploring the local area’ consistently come up in the top 5 reported main benefits. The power of Beat the Street is the ability to deliver positive changes in health through a fun and easy programme.</p><br/><br/><p>Not only does Beat the Street create immediate impacts but it also creates a legacy acting as a catalyst, motivating people with the extrinsic rewards of the game, and leading to the creation of new habits.</p><br/><br/><p>The momentum built during the experience phase of Beat the Street is used to signpost people into continuing activity. Work continues with important stakeholders: health and transport, schools, workplaces, community groups and community champions for 6 months after the Beat the Street game phase.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""further-information"">Further information</h2><br/><br/><p>Contact <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.intelligenthealth.co.uk"">Intelligent Health</a> by telephone 0118 935 7371 or email <a href=""mailto:businessdevelopment@intelligenthealth.co.uk"">businessdevelopment@intelligenthealth.co.uk</a>.</p><br/><br/></div></p>",

Approximately 30% of all women diagnosed with breast cancer report a symptom other than a lump. However, research shows that when asked to name symptoms of breast cancer, only half of women over 70 (48%) could name a symptom aside from a lump.</p><br/><br/><p>Despite older women being at an increased risk of breast cancer, they are also more likely to delay going to their <abbr title=""general practitioner"">GP</abbr> with breast cancer symptoms.  This year’s campaign activity will reinforce the message ‘don’t assume you’re past it’, urging older women to visit their doctor straight away if they notice any unusual or persistent changes to their breasts such as a lump or a change to a nipple or to the skin or the shape of a breast.</p><br/><br/><p>The campaign first launched nationally in early 2014 and research shows that it successfully raised awareness that the risk of breast cancer increases with age. Promising results show a 25% increase in the number of breast cancers diagnosed in women aged 70 and over following an urgent <abbr title=""general practitioner"">GP</abbr> referral for suspected breast cancer during the campaign period compared with the same period 2 years earlier.</p><br/><br/><p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in England, with around 41,200 women diagnosed every year. National figures show that around 9,500 women die from breast cancer each year and over half of these are women aged 70 and over (5,400). This equates to around 15 women aged 70 and over dying from breast cancer in England every day.</p><br/><br/><p>Early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial and means treatment is more likely to be successful. If breast cancer is diagnosed at the earliest stage in women aged 70 and over, 93% will live for at least another 5 years. This figure drops to just 13% for those diagnosed at the most advanced stage.</p><br/><br/><p>Professor Dame Sally Davies, Chief Medical Officer, comments:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>You are never too old to get breast cancer. It is not always a lump and women should look out for any changes in the shape of the breast, a change to a nipple or to the skin.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Spotting the signs of cancer early is very important so if women are concerned about any breast cancer symptoms they should contact their <abbr title=""general practitioner"">GP</abbr> straight away.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Virginia Wade, <abbr title=""Order of the British Empire"">OBE</abbr>, British former professional tennis player is supporting the campaign and comments:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>I’ve just turned 70, which makes this campaign really relevant to me and women like me. The statistics speak for themselves, 1 in 3 women who get breast cancer are over 70.</p><br/><br/>  <p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in England. Sadly, everyone knows someone who has been touched by breast cancer, which is why I’m supporting this campaign. I want to say to all women over 70: don’t assume you’re past it. If you notice any changes to your breasts, tell your doctor. We’re not just talking about a lump - symptoms of breast cancer could also be changes to your breast shape, size, skin or nipple.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Family and friends - please do encourage loved ones to seek medical help if they say they have symptoms or have noticed any changes. Some women feel they are too old for certain things, but unfortunately breast cancer isn’t one of them.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Diana Moran, health writer and international fitness expert comments:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>I know first-hand the effects that breast cancer can have. I was 47 when I was diagnosed with breast cancer and my advice hasn’t changed - get to know your breasts and recognise if there are any changes. The older you get, the more important it is to be aware of your body. You’ll be as surprised as I was to hear that 1 in 3 women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are over 70.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">If you do notice a change in your breasts, whether it’s a lump, discharge or a skin change, go and see your <abbr title=""general practitioner"">GP</abbr> as soon as you can. The chances are that it’s nothing serious!  But it might be something that needs attention and if diagnosed earlier, treatment can be a lot more successful.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Dr Ann Hoskins, <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> Deputy Director, Health and Wellbeing says:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">This campaign aims to target women aged 70 and over, as we know that many women of this age group are unaware of the risk breast cancer poses to them. They also tend to have lower knowledge of the symptoms of breast cancer, and are not necessarily looking at or feeling their breasts so are less likely to detect change.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">This campaign emphasises that a lump is not the only sign of breast cancer and women should tell their <abbr title=""general practitioner"">GP</abbr> if they notice any changes to their breasts. Other possible signs of breast cancer include nipple changes and changes to the skin of the breast.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Dr Jenny Harries, <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> Regional Director, South of England notes:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>We welcome the Be Clear on Cancer campaign returning this year. When comparing figures for the first campaign in 2014 with the same period 2 years earlier, there was a 25% increase in the number of breast cancers diagnosed via an urgent <abbr title=""general practitioner"">GP</abbr> referral.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Around 5,400 women aged 70 and over still die from breast cancer in England each year, so it is absolutely vital that women are properly informed of their risk. It has been estimated that across all age groups around 2,000 deaths from breast cancer could be avoided each year in England if survival rates matched the best in Europe. This latest Be Clear on Cancer campaign has an important role to play in helping increase symptom awareness levels and earlier diagnosis.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Media Medic, Dr Dawn Harper comments:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Breast cancer affects women of all ages, but it’s the number of those over 70 being diagnosed and the fact that some women delay visiting their <abbr title=""general practitioner"">GP</abbr> which is worrying. It is extremely important to seek medical advice if you have any concerns about unusual changes to your breasts and encourage others to do so too. Anyone that visits us will not be wasting our time, as GPs it’s what we’re there for.  If you do have breast cancer, the earlier it is found treatment is more likely to be successful and can lead to a better outcome.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Mr Steven Thrush, consultant breast surgeon, Worcestershire Acute NHS Trusts:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Over the last 12 months I have performed surgery on women who have been prompted to get their symptoms checked because of the Be Clear on Cancer campaign. As a surgeon, I am delighted with this, because the earlier we can diagnose cancer, the more treatment options we can offer our patients.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Sean Duffy, National Clinical Director for Cancer at NHS England, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>Early diagnosis of cancer is absolutely critical to improving survival. Part of this is helping people understand what symptoms to look out for, which is why campaigns like this are so important.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Patients with possible early signs and symptoms should visit their <abbr title=""general practitioner"">GP</abbr> so where necessary they can be referred for tests, and treatment can start quickly. Early diagnosis is a key focus for us and will form part of the NHS’s new plan for cancer, currently being developed by an independent taskforce.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Richard Sutton, breast cancer surgeon at Royal United Hospital Bath, says:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>I often hear my patients say how they delayed going to their <abbr title=""general practitioner"">GP</abbr>. They may not think their symptom is serious, they may be embarrassed or didn’t want to waste the GPs time. Most people are aware that a lump in the breast could be a symptom of cancer, but they don’t know that changes to the skin of the breast or the nipple could also be signs of cancer.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">As a specialist surgeon, it concerns me that the awareness of the importance of these symptoms is even lower amongst older women. The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age, so don’t dismiss any persistent or unusual changes to your breasts as a sign of ageing, speak to your <abbr title=""general practitioner"">GP</abbr> – finding breast cancer early makes it more treatable and could save your life.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>The nationwide Be Clear on Cancer ‘breast cancer in women over 70’ campaign will launch on Monday 13 July and run for 8 weeks.

Be Clear on Cancer campaigns, which aim to raise public awareness of the symptoms of cancer and encourage earlier presentation, form an integral part of the <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> Marketing Plan for 2014 to 2017 which was published in July 2014.</p><br/>  </li><br/>  <li><br/>    <p>Possible signs of breast cancer include:</p><br/><br/>    <ul><br/>      <li>a lump or thickening in your breast or armpit</li><br/>      <li>changes to the skin of your breast</li><br/>      <li>changes in the shape or size of your breast</li><br/>      <li>nipple changes</li><br/>      <li>nipple discharge</li><br/>      <li>pain in your breast</li><br/>      <li>any other unusual or persistent changes to your breasts</li><br/>    </ul><br/>  </li><br/>  <li><br/>    <p>When asked to name symptoms of breast cancer, only half (48%) of women aged 70 and over could name a symptom that isn’t a lump. Knowledge of other breast cancer symptoms is higher amongst those aged 40 to 69, with 73% able to name at least one non-lump symptom.</p><br/>  </li><br/>  <li><br/>    <p>The campaign will use a mixture of TV, press, digital and out of home advertising. Leaflets will also be distributed through outlets such as <abbr title=""general practitioner"">GP</abbr> surgeries.</p><br/>  </li><br/>  <li><br/>    <p>The Be Clear on Cancer ‘breast cancer in women over 70’ campaign was piloted regionally in the Midlands at the beginning of 2013 and first ran nationally from 3 February to 16 March 2014. When comparing February to April 2012 with February to April 2014, the results for women aged 70 and over show a statistically significant 25% increase in the number of breast cancers diagnosed via an urgent <abbr title=""general practitioner"">GP</abbr> referral for suspected breast cancer.</p><br/>  </li><br/>  <li><br/>    <p>Additional breast cancer facts:</p><br/><br/>    <ul><br/>      <li>The UK has 5th highest incidence and 11th highest mortality rate in the EU. It has been estimated that around 2,000 deaths from breast cancer could be avoided in England each year if survival matched the best in Europe.</li><br/>      <li>The key risk factor in breast cancer is sex: more than 99% of all breast cancers are diagnosed in women. Age is also an important risk factor, with around 1 in 3 cases being diagnosed in women aged 70 or older.</li><br/>      <li>Being overweight is the biggest lifestyle risk for female breast cancer, accounting for nearly 1 in 10 cases.</li><br/>    </ul><br/>  </li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Additional quotes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Sara Hiom, Director of Early Diagnosis and Cancer Intelligence, Cancer Research UK, says:</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">This campaign highlights 2 important facts that aren’t well known - that breast cancer isn’t just about lumps, and that older women are most at risk. We hope these latest Be Clear on Cancer adverts will encourage women, especially older ones, to tell their <abbr title=""general practitioner"">GP</abbr> about any unusual or persistent changes to their breasts, be that a lump, or something else like discharge, or a change to the skin or nipple. An early diagnosis, regardless of age, usually makes breast cancer more treatable.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Samia al Qadhi, Chief Executive of Breast Cancer Care, says:</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The sooner breast cancer is diagnosed, the more effective treatment may be, so we welcome this vital campaign to raise awareness among women over 70. Many women don’t realise that the risk of developing the disease actually increases with age and many older women don’t feel confident about checking for symptoms. Knowing your breasts and regularly looking for unusual changes can help spot cancer early, so it’s crucial that information and support are provided. The more women we can reach with Be Clear on Cancer, the better.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Actress Barbara Windsor, said:</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">It is great to be supporting a campaign which brings to attention the subject of breast cancer in the over 70s.  Breast cancer can often be seen as something which is more common in younger women, but as the campaign highlights, 1 in 3 women diagnosed with breast cancer in England each year are aged 70 or over. I’m in my 70s and my advice has always been, and will, never change – be breast aware and tell your doctor if you’re concerned about any potential signs of breast cancer. The more we can get the message out there to each other, the more women could be saved.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><div class=""contact "" id=""contact_2425""><br/>  <div class=""content""><br/>    <h3>Public Health England press office</h3><br/><br/>    <div class=""vcard contact-inner""><br/><br/>        <div class=""email-url-number""><br/>            <p class=""email""><br/>              <span class=""type"">Email</span><br/>              <a class=""email"" href=""mailto:phe-pressoffice@phe.gov.uk"">phe-pressoffice@phe.gov.uk</a><br/>            </p><br/>            <p class=""tel""><br/>              <span class=""type"">Telephone</span><br/>              020 7654 8400<br/>            </p><br/>            <p class=""tel""><br/>              <span class=""type"">Out of hours telephone</span><br/>              020 8200 4400<br/>            </p><br/>        </div><br/><br/><br/>    </div><br/>  </div><br/></div><br/><br/></div></p>",

However, evidence shows the right support helps mums to breastfeed for longer. Public Health England (<abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr>) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months.</p><br/><br/><p>A new survey of 500 mothers of young children commissioned by <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> showed that more than half were concerned that breastfeeding could mean they wouldn’t be able to tell if their baby was getting too much or not enough milk. A similar proportion of mums surveyed thought that people might assume they need a special diet to breastfeed. Nearly 3 in 10 worried that breastfeeding could mean their baby might not be getting the right nutrients, indicating why mothers may stop breastfeeding at this early point.</p><br/><br/><p>Breastfeeding boosts a baby’s ability to fight illness and infection. Babies who are not breastfed are more likely to get diarrhoea and respiratory infections. It lowers a mother’s risk of ovarian and breast cancer, and also burns around 500 calories a day.</p><br/><br/><p>Start4Life, <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr>’s marketing programme that helps parents-to-be and parents to adopt healthy behaviours, has launched a new interactive Breastfeeding Friend (<abbr title=""Breastfeeding Friend"">BFF</abbr>) ChatBot. The <abbr title=""Breastfeeding Friend"">BFF</abbr> is accessed through Facebook messenger and provides personal support for mothers at any time of the day or night to help make breastfeeding a better experience. The <abbr title=""Breastfeeding Friend"">BFF</abbr> will also dispel breastfeeding myths and help alleviate concerns mums have. The ChatBot works as a live chat tool which is able to respond to questions about breastfeeding posed by the user.</p><br/><br/><p>Viv Bennett, Chief Nurse at <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>Breastfeeding, while natural, is something that all mums and their babies learn by doing. Mums tell us that after the first few weeks breastfeeding becomes easier, so proper support is crucial at this time, which is where our <abbr title=""Breastfeeding Friend"">BFF</abbr> is designed to help.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">We can all help women feel comfortable breastfeeding their baby wherever they are. Creating a wider culture of encouragement and support will help make a mother’s experience all the more positive.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>The survey also confirmed that breastfeeding in public is something that mums are concerned about. The mothers polled were most likely to say that they would feel embarrassed breastfeeding in the presence of people they don’t know (63%). 59% feel the same about partner’s family and 49% felt it about siblings and wider family members.</p><br/><br/><p>Minister for Public Health and Innovation Nicola Blackwood said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Research shows that breastfeeding gives babies the best start in life but I know it’s not always easy for new mums to start. Start4Life’s new interactive Facebook messenger ChatBot is a quick and easy way for mums to get help and information, and complements the ongoing support from their midwifery team and health visitor.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Jacque Gerrard, Director for England at Royal College of Midwives’ said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Getting infant feeding right will help give new-born babies the best possible start in life. Women need all the support they can get, particularly first time mothers. It is important that midwives and maternity support workers continue to promote breastfeeding. Any initiative that goes towards helping mothers start and sustain breastfeeding for longer is positive as we know the health benefits from being breastfed last a lifetime.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>High-profile figures who promote breastfeeding had a positive influence on the mums polled. Household names like Sam Faiers, Fearne Cotton and Blake Lively, who have recently championed breastfeeding on social media, inspired 49% of mums to breastfeed their own babies. Two-thirds (64%) felt more confident to breastfeed in public because of celebrity mums.</p><br/><br/><p>For more information, advice and tips on breastfeeding visit: <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.nhs.uk/start4life"">www.nhs.uk/start4life</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>To access the Breastfeeding <abbr title=""Breastfeeding Friend"">BFF</abbr>, simply open Facebook Messenger and search Start4Life BreastFeeding Friend or visit <a rel=""external"" href=""http://m.me/Start4LifeBreastFeedingFriend"">m.me/Start4LifeBreastFeedingFriend</a> to get started.</p><br/><br/><p>For further information, images or interviews please contact:</p><br/><br/><div class=""contact "" id=""contact_2836""><br/>  <div class=""content""><br/>    <h3>freuds</h3><br/><br/>    <div class=""vcard contact-inner""><br/><br/>        <div class=""email-url-number""><br/>            <p class=""email""><br/>              <span class=""type"">Email</span><br/>              <a class=""email"" href=""mailto:start4life@freuds.com"">start4life@freuds.com</a><br/>            </p><br/>            <p class=""tel""><br/>              <span class=""type"">Telephone</span><br/>              020 3003 6399<br/>            </p><br/>        </div><br/><br/><br/>    </div><br/>  </div><br/></div><br/><br/><h2 id=""background"">Background</h2><br/><br/><ol><br/>  <li><br/>    <p>The Start4Life Breastfeeding Friend, <abbr title=""Breastfeeding Friend"">BFF</abbr> for short, is a ChatBot accessible via Facebook Messenger, using Android or iPhones, tablets or computers.

The Muslim Council of Britain has confirmed that breaking fast in such conditions is allowable under Islamic law. Also, make sure to check on others in the community who may be at greater risk to ensure they are having a safe and healthy Ramadan.

The report also recommends that consumption of sugar sweetened drinks is minimised and fibre increased.</p><br/><br/><p>Duncan Selbie, Chief Executive of <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr>, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">One-fifth of 10 to 11 year olds are obese and almost two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese and sugary drinks are a major contributor. There is nothing good about a sugary drink, particularly if you are under the age of 11, and we must work together to find ways to wean ourselves from the sugar habit.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>The recommendation on sugars represents a huge challenge to the population, the government and industry, as both young people and adults already exceeded the previous recommendation. Given the serious health implications of being overweight or obese, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers, <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> is urging parents to take action now, starting with sugary drinks.</p><br/><br/><p>Dr Alison Tedstone, Chief Nutritionist at <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr>, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>We’re asking parents to take a big step to establish a lifetime of healthy eating habits for their children by replacing sugary drinks with sugar free and no added sugar drinks, lower fat milks or water.</p><br/><br/>  <p>Sugary drinks have no place in a child’s daily diet, but account for almost a third of their daily sugar intake. Too much sugar leads to excess calorie intake, weight gain and obesity, itself leading to heart disease, some cancers and type 2 diabetes in adults.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">But individual action is just part of the solution. We’re finalising a review of wider factors that influence how much sugar we consume, from marketing and promotions to reformulation and fiscal measures, so we can look at what we can all do to help the country lead healthier lives.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition"">SACN</abbr>’s findings are the first wide ranging look at the relationship between sugar consumption and health outcomes in the UK since the 1990s. The report found consuming sugary drinks is leading to unhealthy weight gain in children and young people. For children, too much sugar is linked with a greater risk of tooth decay. In adults, it leads to them consuming too many calories.</p><br/><br/><p>Figures from the national diet and nutrition survey, referenced in the <abbr title=""Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition"">SACN</abbr> report, found sugary drinks to be the highest contributor of sugars to the diet of 4 to 10 year olds. They consume:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>30% from soft drinks and fruit juice</li><br/>  <li>29% mainly from biscuits, cakes and breakfast cereals</li><br/>  <li>22% from sweets, chocolate, table sugar, jams and other sweet spreads</li><br/>  <li>12% from yoghurts, fromage frais, ice-cream, and other dairy desserts</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>While <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> has identified cutting sugary drinks as the first step parents can take, updated advice from its childhood obesity prevention campaign, Change4Life, also provides families with advice on how to cut down on other sugary foods. In addition, people are now being strongly advised to have only one 150 mililitre serving of fruit juice or smoothie per day, with a meal, as part of their 5 a day because of the high levels of sugar they contain.</p><br/><br/><p>When <abbr title=""Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition"">SACN</abbr> published its draft report in June 2014, <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> embarked on a review of possible measures to reduce sugar consumption, including reformulation, marketing and promotions of high-sugar food and drink, and fiscal measures, looking at the impact they could have. The government asked <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> to use the evidence from this review to advise on actions it could take to lower sugar consumption, informing its wider obesity and diabetes strategy. <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> is finalising this evidence review and will publish it later this summer.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""background"">Background:</h3><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Definitions of sugar vary.

This is linked to exposure to reptiles, in particular to snakes. There have been 70 cases of this type of salmonella across England, so far in 2015.</p><br/><br/><p>Professor Jeremy Hawker, a salmonella expert at <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>It is already well established that there is a risk of salmonella associated with pet reptiles. Reptiles, including snakes, have long been known to carry particular types of salmonella, most carry salmonella in their gut and shed the bacteria in their droppings. These droppings can quickly spread over the reptile’s skin and any surface or object they come into contact with including cages, toys, clothes, furniture and household surfaces.</p><br/><br/>  <p>Raw or frozen mice used as snake feed may be the principal route of disease transmission in this outbreak. Such feeder mice have previously been found to be a source of salmonella and present a risk to those who handle them.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Babies and children under 5 are particularly at risk from infection. Children who had no contact with reptiles can also get infected indirectly through the reptile handler or by contamination of the environment. However, many children can be curious and like to handle and stroke pet reptiles and as a result their hands and fingers become contaminated. Added to this, children do not have fully developed immune systems and so are therefore at increased risk of becoming severely ill following exposure to salmonella.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>To reduce the risk of developing a salmonella infection, reptile owners are advised to:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after handling your reptile, their cage or any other equipment such as soaking pools</li><br/>  <li>defrost frozen feeds on newspaper or kitchen towels preferably overnight, and away from food and food preparation surfaces and equipment and avoid defrosting in warm water or microwave as this can lead to a risk of cross contamination</li><br/>  <li>always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after feeding your reptile, in particular after handling raw (frozen or defrosted) mice, rats or chicks</li><br/>  <li>ensure that all surfaces that have come into contact with the defrosting food are cleaned thoroughly afterwards</li><br/>  <li>not eat or drink while handling your reptile or its food and associated equipment</li><br/>  <li>always supervise children to ensure that they do not put your reptile or objects that the reptile has been in contact with, near their mouths, and wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after handling your reptile or such objects</li><br/>  <li>keep your reptile out of rooms where food is prepared and eaten</li><br/>  <li>limit the parts of the house where your reptile is allowed to roam freely</li><br/>  <li>not use kitchen sinks to bathe your reptile, wash their cage or equipment or defrost feed and if you use a bathroom sink or bathtub, it must be cleaned thoroughly with disinfectant afterwards</li><br/>  <li>dispose of wastewater, droppings and urine from your reptile down the toilet instead of a sink or bathtub</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>If you or other family members become ill with symptoms such as diarrhoea, fever, abdominal pain or vomiting, consult your doctor and inform the doctor that you own or keep a reptile.</p><br/><br/><p>Salmonella is a bacterium that is naturally found in the gut of many animals, including reptiles. This bacterium can spread from the animals to cause infection in people, in most just causing a mild illness with diarrhoea, fever, abdominal pain and nausea, but children and babies can develop more serious illness. Just over 1% of the population own or keep reptiles in England.</p><br/><br/><p>Guidance on <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/salmonella-reducing-infection-from-reptiles"">Salmonella: reducing infection from reptiles</a> is available on the <abbr title=""Public Health England"">PHE</abbr> website.</p><br/><br/><p>Image by <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/destinysagent"">Steve Smith</a>.
