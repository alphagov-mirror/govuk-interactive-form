These difficulties have been the basis for disputes and requests for advice for the Government Chemist team for a number of years.</p><br/><br/><p>Food additive law bans the use of a range of gel-forming compounds in such products to avoid the possibility of ‘plugging’ the airway. Disputes arise, not about the presence of the additives, but about the definition of the product in which they are banned. If a jelly confectionery product conforms to the definition of a jelly mini-cup, it must not contain the banned gel forming additives.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""workshop-on-assessment-of-jelly-cups"">Workshop on assessment of jelly cups</h3><br/><br/><p>As a consequence of our involvement in assisting the authorities and businesses to interpret the relevant legislation since 2004, we have gathered extensive expertise in the evaluation and assessment of these confectionery items. We organised <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/evaluation-and-assessment-of-jelly-mini-cups-workshop"">a workshop</a> covering advice and guidance to interested groups on the assessment and evaluation that took place on 13 March at LGC in Teddington with the aim of disseminating that expertise.</p><br/><br/><figure class=""image embedded""><div class=""img""><img src=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/85550/Michael_Walker_jelly_-_lab_GOV.uk.jpg"" alt=""Michael Walker in the laboratory""></div><br/><figcaption>Michael Walker in the laboratory demonstrating practical aspects of the assessment of jelly mini-cups</figcaption></figure><br/><br/><p>The workshop was oversubscribed, attended by 22 delegates representing enforcement offices (Trading Standard Officers and Environmental Health Officers), Public Analysts and traders.

In the course of his oration he invoked Pericles, Virgil and Dryden, he poured scorn on Disraeli’s doctrine of Imperium et Libertas, he discussed the merits of the Andrassy Note and the Treaty of San Stefano and he outlined six principles of Liberal foreign policy - specifically a limit on legislation and public expenditure at home to conserve the nation’s strength, the preservation of peace, the maintenance of a balance of power in Europe, the avoidance of needless entanglements, the acknowledgement of the equal rights of all nations and a positive bias in favour of those people fighting for freedom.</p><br/><br/><p>In the same address, Gladstone also compared the arguments for Protection and Free Trade, enumerating the advantages of Free Trade, he discussed the folly of land reform and the break up of great estates as a remedy for agricultural distress and he went onto argue that wealth creators should be free from every unjust and unnecessary legislative restraint.</p><br/><br/><p>Impressive you might say. Some admirable sentiments you might be inclined to agree. With which all of us who might aspire to be Mr Gladstone’s heirs in the Commons would do well to acquaint ourselves.</p><br/><br/><p>Invited to reflect on other contrasts between then and now you might consider how far standards of oratory had fallen. You wouldn’t get a speech like that in Parliament today.</p><br/><br/><p>But Gladstone wasn’t speaking in Parliament. He was addressing a crowd of landless agricultural workers and coal miners in Scotland’s central belt.</p><br/><br/><p>Gladstone’s Third Midlothian Address is remembered today, insofar as it is remembered today, as the culminating moment in his back-to-the-people, grass-roots, comeback kid campaign for the premiership.</p><br/><br/><p>It deserves to be remembered as an important moment in the Manichean struggle between the crusader Gladstone and his cynical adversary Disraeli, between the Liberal Party in its High Victorian heyday as a guardian of limited Government and a Tory Party of a proudly imperial kind that we no longer know.</p><br/><br/><p>But the reason I recall that speech now, is because the most striking thing about the Midlothian campaign is not how different today’s Liberals and Tories are from those of one hundred and thirty years ago.</p><br/><br/><p>I think the most striking thing is how different the public of 130 years ago were.</p><br/><br/><p>Or more specifically, how different were the expectations that the political class had of that public.</p><br/><br/><p>It was assumed that an audience of agricultural labourers and mineworkers would either be familiar with or, at the very least be curious about, Pericles and Dryden, the intricacies of the Andrassy Note and the deficiencies of the San Stefano Treaty, the merits of Protection and the arguments from first principles for Free Trade.</p><br/><br/><p>The public were paid the compliment of assuming they were intellectually curious. They weren’t patronised by being treated as rude mechanicals.</p><br/><br/><p>It would have been unthinkable for Gladstone to have used the House of Commons to answer a question on the fate of a character in a soap opera, as Tony Blair did when he expressed his support for the innocence of Deirdre Rachid.</p><br/><br/><p>It would have been inconceivable for any member of his Cabinet to have sought public approbation by letting the world know they had the critical tastes of a teenager, as Gordon Brown once did, when he confessed his fondness for the Arctic Monkeys.</p><br/><br/><p>It would have been impossible to credit if any leading politician of their age had been asked, as Nick Clegg was, how many lovers they had taken before marriage, or as David Cameron was, whether or not he had harboured lurid sexual fantasies about a previous party leader.</p><br/><br/><p>I draw these comparisons not because I am such a narrow nostalgist that I wish to live in a pristine past purged of modern popular culture.</p><br/><br/><p>I draw them because I look back with admiration at the great Victorian statesman, their intellectual and cultural self-confidence, and in particular the great ambitions they harboured for the British people.</p><br/><br/><p>It was an automatic assumption of my predecessors in Cabinet office that the education they had enjoyed, the culture they had benefitted from, the literature they had read, the history they had grown up learning, were all worth knowing. They thought that the case was almost so self-evident it scarcely needed to be made. To know who Pericles was, why he was important, why acquaintance with his actions, thoughts and words mattered, didn’t need to be explained or justified. It was the mark of an educated person. And to aspire to be educated, and be thought of as educated, was the noblest of ambitions.</p><br/><br/><p>The Eminent Victorian, and muscular liberal, Matthew Arnold encapsulated what liberal learning should be. He wanted to introduce young minds to the best that had been thought and written. His was a cause which was subsequently embraced by leaders of Victorian opinion as a civilizing mission which it was their moral duty to discharge.</p><br/><br/><p>In an age before structuralism, relativism and post-modernism it seemed a natural and uncomplicated thing, the mark of civilization, to want to spread knowledge, especially the knowledge of great human achievement, to every open mind.</p><br/><br/><p>But, over time, that natural and uncomplicated belief has been undermined, over-complicated and all too often twisted out of shape.</p><br/><br/><p>Well today I want to reclaim it. I want to proclaim the importance of education as a good in itself. I want to argue that introducing the young minds of the future to the great minds of the past is our duty. I want to argue that we should be more demanding of our education system, demanding of academics, headteachers, professionals in school and students of all ages. We should recover something of that Victorian earnestness which believed that an audience would be gripped more profoundly by a passionate hour long lecture from a gifted thinker which ranged over poetry and politics than by cheap sensation and easy pleasures.</p><br/><br/><p>Intellectual exercise, like physical exertion, or so I’m told, becomes easier the harder you work. A consistent investment of intellectual effort brings the satisfaction of seeing problems dissolve before your analytical gaze.</p><br/><br/><p>I think any society is a better society for taking intellectual effort more seriously, for rewarding intellectual ambition, for indulging curiosity, for supporting scholarship, for feting those who teach and celebrating those who learn.</p><br/><br/><p>I believe that because I believe we have all been endowed, either by a generous creator or by those selfish genes, with the capacity to share in greatness.</p><br/><br/><p>We may not all be able to inherit good looks or great houses, but all of us are heir to the amazing intellectual achievements of our ancestors. We can all marvel at the genius of Pythagoras, or Wagner, share in the brilliance of Shakespeare or Newton, delve deeper into the mysteries of human nature through Balzac or Pinker, by taking the trouble to be educated.</p><br/><br/><p>I believe that denying any child access to that amazing legacy, that treasure-house of wonder, delight, stimulation and enchantment by failing to educate them to the utmost of their abilities is as great a crime as raiding their parents bank accounts - you are stealing from their rightful inheritance, condemning them to a future poorer than they deserve.</p><br/><br/><p>And I am unapologetic in arguing that all children have a right to the best. And there is such as thing as the best. Richard Wagner is an artist of sublime genius and his work is incomparably more rewarding - intellectually, sensually and emotionally - than, say, the Arctic Monkeys. Yet it takes effort to prise open the door to his world. That effort is rewarded a thousandfold. The unfulfilled yearning of the Tristan chord, the battle between power and love in the Ring, the sublimity of sacrifice in Parsifal, all these creations of one mind can, today, move and affect the minds of millions with a profundity almost no other work of man can achieve.</p><br/><br/><p>But for any of us to properly appreciate and enjoy Wagner takes time. And work. The oft-quoted jibe that Wagner has some great moments but some terrible quarters of an hour underlines how inaccessible he can be, at first.</p><br/><br/><p>But one of the first lessons we learn on the road to maturity is that the greatest pleasures are those which need to be worked at. Instant gratification palls. Investing care and attention, and deferring gratification, brings understanding, appreciation and real enjoyment. Whether its friendship or cooking, listening to Richard Wagner or appreciating a work by Nicolas Poussin, the more time and care that is invested the richer and deeper the rewards.</p><br/><br/><p>Which is why I am worried that far too often we do not expect, let alone, demand the level of effort, application and ambition of which students are capable. We do not seek to stretch them, and reward them, as Gladstone stretched and rewarded his audience of labourers one hundred and thirty years ago.</p><br/><br/><p>I accept that some may think my position is romantic - hopelessly so. How can I talk of Pericles and Wagner when the young people I dream of engaging with Greek heroes and German operas were on our streets this summer rioting and are on our conscience this winter as the number of young unemployed appears to rise remorselessly?</p><br/><br/><p>Well, yes, I am romantic in one sense I suppose. Promethean even. I believe man is born with a thirst for free inquiry and is nearly everywhere held back by chains of low expectation. I am convinced there is an unsatisfied hunger for seriousness and an unfulfilled yearning for the demanding among our citizens.</p><br/><br/><p>In Willy Russell’s drama Educating Rita, his heroine, played by Julie Walters in the film version, is portrayed at one point in a cosy Merseyside pub with her friends and family as they, increasingly merrily, belt out the familiar numbers they’ve sung along with all their lives.</p><br/><br/><p>As a picture of traditional working class solidarity, it’s moving - in current circumstances it’s even elegiac. But, as Russell knows, it’s also constricting. Rita, growing frustrated with the limited horizons of her close-knit community, insists “there must be better songs to sing” and seeks them in education.</p><br/><br/><p>Her subsequent, earnest and driven, pursuit of knowledge helps rescue her tutor, Frank, from his jaded and complacent approach to learning as he recovers, through her, his original enthusiasm for literature.</p><br/><br/><p>Educating Rita is fiction of course, but it resonates because there are so many of our fellow citizens who know there are better songs to sing than those they hear around them every day.</p><br/><br/><p>The appetite among parents from poorer homes for strenuous educational excellence - for stretch and challenge - is constantly under-estimated.</p><br/><br/><p>Let me illustrate my point with one anecdote. And then some data. The anecdote first.</p><br/><br/><p>Jade Goody may be an unfamiliar name to many of you. But she is the epitome of a celebrity famous for being famous. A contestant on the crudely exploitative TV game show Big Brother she was singled out for notoriety because she appeared so tragically poorly educated. She didn’t know where or what East ‘Angular’ was, she seemed at sea with any literary, historical, cultural or political reference - and therefore she became a poster girl for general ignorance and terminal educational failure.</p><br/><br/><p>To her enormous credit, she turned this notoriety into celebrity, turned scorn into sympathy and transformed a fleeting appearance in a game show into the launchpad for a hugely successful modern media career.</p><br/><br/><p>Her life was cut tragically short, however, by cancer. But before she died she worked harder than ever to set up a trust fund for her sons. With the explicit aim of enrolling them in one of Essex’s most traditional prep schools and then ensuring they could go onto public school.</p><br/><br/><p>Scorned as she may have been, almost by the whole nation, for her lack of education, Jade knew its worth. If she merely wanted her children to be rich she need simply have left them her wealth. But she wanted more - she wanted them to be educated, to have their minds enriched.</p><br/><br/><p>And lest you think Jade is an exotic exception, a bird of bright plumage atypical of her environment, consider the facts on the ground now in our capital.</p><br/><br/><p>For generations the working class communities of South London have been tragically ill-served by council-run schools which consistently failed to secure a decent clutch of GCSEs or their equivalent for the overwhelming majority of their pupils. It was assumed that the children could scarcely be expected to do better, given their backgrounds. And parents were denied any meaningful information about how their children’s schools performed relative to others so they had no real idea how badly they were being betrayed by those who took their votes, council rents and rates for granted.</p><br/><br/><p>But recently those families have been given an alternative. Through a combination of league tables, schools free of council control, and headteachers free to hire who they want and pay them what they want.</p><br/><br/><p>As a result of these changes we can see that for example the peer Lord Harris of Peckham now runs a dozen comprehensives which were once local authority controlled schools. They draw pupils from the same communities that they always have, and they enjoy the same level of funding as all their neighbours. But their results are incomparably better. Ten times as many students get five good GCSE passes as a few years ago. The rate of performance improvement is far faster than that of any neighbouring school. And schools which once struggled to fill their classrooms are now hugely over-subscribed.</p><br/><br/><p>And that’s because so many parents, and its often parents who themselves were denied a great education themselves, yearn to see their own children properly educated. And they know what that entails almost instinctively.</p><br/><br/><p>They know that mathematics, English, the sciences, foreign languages, history and geography are rigorous intellectual disciplines tested over time and want those subjects prominent in the curriculum. They know that ordered classrooms with strict discipline are a precondition for effective teaching and a sanctuary from the dangers of the street. They know that respect for teachers as guardians of knowledge and figures of authority is the beginning of wisdom. And as a result we now have a situation where parents don’t just flock to these schools, they actively petition local authorities to allow Lord Harris to take over their schools.</p><br/><br/><p>The Harris academies, like those of ARK, E-ACT, ULT and others are providing children with the opportunity to transcend the circumstances of their birth, just as the grammar schools of the past gave an, admittedly smaller, proportion of their predecessors similar opportunities.</p><br/><br/><p>And to visit these schools is to be reminded, at every turn, of what a love of learning looks like.</p><br/><br/><p>In Burlington Danes, an Academy run by the charity ARK in White City, academic excellence is recognised with a rank order system for every pupil in every year, allocating a place to every child in every term based on their performance subject by subject. So at half term the children are examined, given their scores from 1 to 120.  That’s kept private. Then they have the opportunity in the remaining half term to improve their scores and at the end of it every student in every year is ranked, in every subject and for effort, and also artistic and sporting achievement. When I encountered this the first time I thought - that’s a bit hard core, must be unpopular with some of the parents and some of the students. But actually I was told that this had been the single most popular change that had been initiated. The children were now so anxious to do well in this competitive process, which rewards the acquisition of knowledge, that they petition the head to have them transferred out of classes where teachers are weak into those where teaching is strong. They know when they are being fed material which is thin gruel intellectually and they demand better. They ask for more homework and additional reading. They thirst to know.</p><br/><br/><p>In another Academy school that I visited just last week, Denbigh High, the students, overwhelming Asian, second and third generation immigrant families, competed to tell me why they preferred Shakespeare to Dickens and they showed me how alliteration, personification and first person narration helped hook readers into the openings of particular novels.</p><br/><br/><p>When students from the communities that these schools serve display such passion for learning they only underline how poorly we serve so many of their contemporaries.</p><br/><br/><p>Because while schools such as these may ensure that three quarters of their students get five good GCSEs, the whole country only succeeds in getting half of young people to that level.</p><br/><br/><p>And what’s worse is that just around 16 per cent manage to succeed in getting to secure a C pass or better at GCSE in English, Maths, the sciences, a language and history or geography.</p><br/><br/><p>And lest you think that a C pass in these subjects is an impossibly high hurdle for many young people consider this.</p><br/><br/><p>It is possible to secure a C pass in mathematics GCSE with less than 35% of the questions right.</p><br/><br/><p>Until this Government came to power there was no formal recognition of grammar punctuation or spelling in the mark schemes for GCSE.</p><br/><br/><p>Conventional grammar - as we understand it here and as Simon Heffer lays it out masterfully in his wonderful book Strictly English - doesn’t feature in the English curriculum.</p><br/><br/><p>But the English Language GCSE can include listening to tape recordings of Eddie Izzard and the Hairy Bikers.</p><br/><br/><p>In English Literature, many students will only have read one novel for their exam - and the overwhelming number - more than ninety per cent - will have studied only either Of Mice and Men, Lord of the Flies or To Kill a Mockingbird. Out of more than 300,000 students who took one exam body’s English Literature GCSE last year, just 1,700 - fewer than 1% will have studied a novel from before 1900 for the exam.</p><br/><br/><p>In science GCSE students are asked which is healthier - a grilled fish or battered sausages?</p><br/><br/><p>In History GCSE, only a tiny proportion of students who get the chance to choose the papers study for those which deal with our own past in any depth - the overwhelming majority focus on the American West 1840 to 1895 or the Nazis.</p><br/><br/><p>I could go on.</p><br/><br/><p>I could explain that it’s possible to secure a good pass at A level in a modern language without having studied any work of foreign literature.</p><br/><br/><p>I could relay the sentiments expressed to me by members of the Royal Society last week who found current science A levels inadequate preparation for university study.</p><br/><br/><p>I could even quote from Robert Tombs, a history don here in Cambridge who lamented in the London Review of Books that, “The present system - curriculum, examination methods and teaching practices combined - is ineffective in producing skills or knowledge, breadth or depth. It drills students to write formulaic essays on causation and mechanically ‘evaluate’ miscellaneous texts for ‘reliability’. And it’s boring: students and teachers are stuck in a round of tests, exercises and exams, which discourages them from venturing outside the limits of a fragmented and decontextualised curriculum. Hence a level of ignorance that still sometimes makes me gasp, and complacency about that ignorance, as if no one could possibly know anything not specifically taught.”</p><br/><br/><p>I could go on but I think you get the picture.</p><br/><br/><p>That is why the Coalition Government is reforming our national curriculum - so that every parent and every child is clear on the essential knowledge they need in the subjects that matter.</p><br/><br/><p>It’s also why we’re reforming our whole exam system - so our GCSEs and A-levels can stand comparison with the most rigorous exams in the highest-performing jurisdictions.</p><br/><br/><p>And also it’s why we’re ensuring those schools with the worst academic record are taken over by organisations with a proven track record of educational excellence.</p><br/><br/><p>Schools in East Manchester which have under-performed for years are now being transformed, as Academies, through the example set by the leadership of Altrincham Girls’ Grammar School.</p><br/><br/><p>A comprehensive in Wiltshire which had not allowed service children to fulfil their potential is now being transformed as an Academy sponsored by Wellington College.</p><br/><br/><p>Uppingham is supporting schools from Preston to Grimsby which desperately needed to have their ambitions raised beyond what they have ever achieved in the past. Brighton College is setting up a new academy school for the very brightest sixth-formers in one of the most deprived parts of the East End of London to give them an equal chance to compete for university places with students at fee-paying schools.</p><br/><br/><p>Overall there are now more than 1,400 academies and free schools in England - a 700% increase in the numbers we inherited - all of them are schools free from local authority control and focused entirely on raising standards. They have all the freedoms of independent schools over curriculum, staffing, timetabling and ethos. And I expect great things of them.</p><br/><br/><p>But 1,400 is not enough. And to take reform to the next stage I want to enlist more unashamedly elitist institutions in helping to entrench independence and extend excellence in our state sector. I want universities like Cambridge, and more of our great public schools, to help run state schools. They will be free of any government interference, free to hire whoever they want, pay them whatever they want, teach whatever they want, and as a result we can demand higher standards.</p><br/><br/><p>I want this because I believe in a truly liberal approach to education - like that outlined by John Stuart Mill - where the state provides the finance and sets high expectations but the delivery of education and the management of day-to-day learning is devolved to genuinely independent schools and chains of schools.</p><br/><br/><p>And I also believe we must be more radical in our reform programme because we are still not asking enough of our education system, and we are not being ambitious enough for our young people.</p><br/><br/><p>Now of course I acknowledge that children are working harder and as I’ve said on every platform I’ve been given, and as I’ve always said, I believe that the young teachers who are now entering the profession are better than any generation of teachers ever before.</p><br/><br/><p>But I don’t believe it is enough to compare ourselves with the recent past and assume that incremental progress from where we once were is enough.</p><br/><br/><p>That lack of ambition would have appalled our Victorian ancestors. And it’s certainly not apparent in other nations. In the last ten years we have fallen behind other countries. We have fallen from 4th in the world for the quality of our science education to16th. 7th in the world for literacy to 25th. 8th in the world for maths to 28th. In Shanghai 14 year olds are two years ahead of their English contemporaries in maths skills.</p><br/><br/><p>In Singapore and Hong Kong children are introduced to calculations involving fractions and the foundations of algebra long before our children.</p><br/><br/><p>In Poland and Hungary children are expected to be familiar with a canon of great literature more extensive and demanding than any we have ever prescribed.</p><br/><br/><p>Now there are very powerful economic reasons why this relative decline should worry us. Globalisation may be a moderately ugly word for what is really just the victory of liberal economics or Victorian political economy over its rivals - but its consequences of globalisation for those without qualifications are truly ugly.</p><br/><br/><p>The number of jobs available in this country to those with few, or no, qualifications is rapidly diminishing as lower wage costs abroad, and technological advance at home, bear down on employment opportunities.</p><br/><br/><p>Those countries with the best educated workforces will be the most attractive to investors, particularly if those workforces are mathematically and scientifically literate and have displayed a talent for hard work and application throughout their student days.</p><br/><br/><p>The more connected, and numerous, your population of well-educated citizens are, the greater the potential for intellectual collaboration and creativity, driving innovation and growth. Whether its Palo Alto or Silicon Fen, there’s a reason why we need to preserve the idea of communities of scholars which the original founders of Oxford and Cambridge established.</p><br/><br/><p>Countries which award soft qualifications to students, which are not comparable to those in the most rigorous jurisdictions, suffer just as surely as a country which issues money too promiscuously to pay its debts suffers. Grade inflation, like currency inflation, costs us all in the long run.</p><br/><br/><p>So I believe we need to do everything we can to stimulate economic growth and I have argued that the best way of doing so is for policies to drive up educational standards. There is no question but that a better educated population is our best long-term growth strategy. Investment in intellectual capital is the best way of a nation securing a proper return on its money.</p><br/><br/><p>But it is important that while we acknowledge the critical role that higher educational standards can play in generating wealth and spreading opportunity more evenly, it’s really important that we do not subordinate education to purely economic ends.</p><br/><br/><p>If we are to recapture and reclaim the importance of liberal learning we must always state that education is a good in itself.</p><br/><br/><p>And in our anxiety to explain, as I have to, why a focus on educational excellence makes sense economically I must make sure that I do not fall into the trap of justifying learning only in utilitarian or instrumentalist economic terms.</p><br/><br/><p>I acknowledge that one of the reasons why we want economic growth is so that we can ensure that the place of learning in our culture and civilization is protected, and enlarged.</p><br/><br/><p>I want, not for economic reasons but for the best of reasons, more of our fellow citizens to study English literature in depth. I want that because the great works of the canon contain eternal truths about human nature conveyed with a profundity and weight it’s impossible to encounter anywhere else.</p><br/><br/><p>Middlemarch should be part of the mental furniture of many more of our fellow citizens because its lessons about respecting the autonomy and individuality of others, its exercise of imaginative sympathy, its belief that one should not seek to make instruments of others to satisfy your own will and its author’s recognition that good is more often achieved by modest persistence than grand projects are all conveyed with such sublime and generous mastery of feeling and language that it is a delight to spend time in the presence of George Eliot’s genius.</p><br/><br/><p>Whether its Austen’s understanding of personal morality, Dickens’ righteous indignation, Hardy’s stern pagan virtue, all of these authors have something rich to teach us which no other experience, other than intimate connection with their novels, can possibly match.</p><br/><br/><p>I also want more of our fellow citizens to study mathematics and science to a higher level because there is a beauty and wonder in the physical world, a poetry and pattern in number, an awe and excitement in mapping creation which takes all our brains onto a higher plane.</p><br/><br/><p>Scientific reasoning, the falsifiability of assumptions, the need to measure reliably, weigh evidence rigorously, submit to the examination of peers, all of these things which science teaches us contribute to the questioning mindset our society needs if it is to avoid error, falsity, superstition and folly.</p><br/><br/><p>Similarly the study of history is important. Not just because it is an excitement in itself - because it brings us into direct contact with the lives of those great men and women who bent events to their will. It also teaches us how to weigh evidence, test assertions, sort good arguments from bad, plausible explanations from bogus.</p><br/><br/><p>I also believe in the study of a foreign language because it extends not just the reach of our empathy but it opens up new ways of reasoning and judging. It allows us to see how complex individual societies and cultures are, gives us a new way of observing the world and ourselves. It gives us a privileged vantage point accessible only after hard work, but worth it because so much is revealed.</p><br/><br/><p>I believe in the application to all these subjects because they cultivate the mind - and they inculcate in the citizen the virtues we once called republican.</p><br/><br/><p>It was a central argument of renaissance historians and political theorists that any republic or commonwealth - whether the Rome of the time before the Caesars or the Holland of the seventeenth century - needed citizens who were schooled in virtue if it was to survive and prosper.</p><br/><br/><p>Open, and participative political systems could not long endure if men were left simply to follow their appetites or allowed, unprotected, to fall prey to demagoguery.</p><br/><br/><p>If these polities were to succeed then citizens needed not just a technical education in a skill to earn their living or basic literacy and numeracy to learn the laws and pay their taxes. They needed to have learned lessons from history, studied the examples of great men from the past, developed robust reasoning skills, had a grounding in ethics, learned to appreciate the importance of art and music, architectural and natural beauty. Without that knowledge, that understanding that the survival and enhancement of a civilization and its culture mattered more than manoeuvring for personal advantage, a society it as thought would inevitably decline, dragging all its citizens with it.</p><br/><br/><p>And it is to you, as members of this University, that I now look for champions ready to enter the public square uphold the pursuit of knowledge as a good in itself.</p><br/><br/><p>And ultimately I cannot put it better than Gladstone did, in another of his great speeches, his rectorial address to the University of Glasgow.</p><br/><br/><p>He was concerned about the dominance in the life of the nation of a new class of speculative financiers who were united only by “the bond of gain, not the legitimate produce of toil by hand or brain.” They, in an uncanny prefiguring of what happened with derivatives, “gave their name to speculations which they neither understand nor examine” and their endorsement means they act as “decoys to allure the unwary and entrap them” into unwise investments.</p><br/><br/><p>The growth of these individuals who were indulging in such speculations was proof, Gladstone thought, that “we live in a time when, among the objects offered to the desire of a man, wealth and the fruits of wealth have augmented their always dangerous preponderance.”</p><br/><br/><p>We might well reflect on the appositeness of that warning for our own times - and in particular the importance of places of learning as bulwarks against greed and materialism.</p><br/><br/><p>Universities were, Gladstone argued, “places of hard labour and modest emoluments” well that much hasn’t changed…</p><br/><br/><p>…”but the improvement of the condition of the student flows from the improvement of the condition of his mind, from the exercise and expansion of his powers to perceive and to reflect, from the formation of habits of attention and application, from a bias given to character in favour of cultivating intelligence for its own sake, as well as for the sake of the direct advantages it brings.”</p><br/><br/><p>“The habits of mind formed by universities are founded in sobriety and tranquillity, they help to settle the spirit of a man firmly upon the centre of gravity; they tend to self-command, self- government and genuine self-respect.”</p><br/><br/><p>“All honour then to the University, because while it prepares students in the most useful manner for the practical purposes of life, it embodies a protest against the excessive dominion of worldly appetites and supplies a powerful agency to neutralizing the specific dangers of this age.”</p><br/><br/><p>To which I can only say, as I’m sure the audience at the Third Midlothian Address did, hear, hear….</p><br/></div></p>",

Greece bequeathed her mathematical heritage to Rome and the achievements of the Caesars, their imperial highways, feats of engineering and centralised accounts, were all the fruits of mathematical knowledge.</p><br/><br/><p>Rome’s fall was the prelude to Islam’s rise and again mathematical innovation was the leading indicator of historical progress. While Western Europe was sunk in a Dark Age of dynastic squabbling, pagan aggression and superstitious poverty the Islamic world flourished, advanced and subdued its foes while also nurturing a series of mathematical thinkers responsible for transmitting wisdom and generating great historic breakthroughs. Whether it was the establishment of Arabic numerals as the principal method of mathematical notation or the invention of algebra, Arabic and Islamic culture was the world’s forcing-house of progress for centuries.</p><br/><br/><p>Europe only caught up again in the sixteenth century, but when we did it was with a burst of mathematical innovation which once more moved the world on its axis. Galileo and Descartes authored advances in mechanics and geometry which were hugely ground-breaking. They were followed by the arguably even greater geniuses of Newton and Leibniz.</p><br/><br/><p>Newton, the greatest President this society has had - so far - was the godfather of the Enlightenment, mankind’s great period of intellectual flowering, the liberation from ignorance on which our current freedoms rest.</p><br/><br/><p>In the nineteenth century, the greatest mathematicians were Germans - like Karl Friedrich Gauss and Bernard Riemann - reflecting the shift of intellectual innovation, and economic power, to central Europe.</p><br/><br/><p>In the twentieth century, the flight of mathematicians like Kurt Godel from a fascist Europe sunk in a new barbarism to a new world of liberty and promise again presaged a fundamental shift in economic, political and intellectual power.</p><br/><br/><p>In the last few generations, it has been the breakthroughs of mathematicians and theoretical physicists working in the US that has allowed mankind to progress from only the vaguest and most approximate understanding of our world to precise quantitative models.</p><br/><br/><p>Richard Feynman has described the precision of quantum mechanics as like being able to measure the distance from New York to L.A to the nearest hair’s breadth. And for those of us navigating journeys even more fraught and perilous than an odyssey across America - such as driving from West London to Westminster without hitting roadworks - the precision of GPS satellite technology can guide us - and all thanks to the extraordinary precision of relativity’s equations.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""falling-behind"">Falling behind</h2><br/><br/><p>And if we want mathematics to guide us into the future, it is easy to see in which direction history is currently moving: East.</p><br/><br/><p>The nations of East Asia, large and small, are now in the position the Islamic world was a millennium ago or Europe enjoyed during the Renaissance. Individually, they now increasingly resemble the England of the eighteenth century, the Germany of the nineteenth or the USA in the twentieth.</p><br/><br/><p>They are growing rapidly industrially and technologically; integrating more and more of their people into the global economy; investing more and more in maths and science; producing the engineers, technicians, scientists and inventors who will shape tomorrow’s world.</p><br/><br/><p>While Europe is chronically indebted, its currency under strain, its growth anaemic, and Continental universities in relative decline, Asia has a massive trade surplus, holds the fate of the dollar in its hands, enjoys surging growth and is developing schools, technical colleges and universities which are dramatically outpacing our own.</p><br/><br/><p>At school, British 15-year-olds’ maths skills are now more than two whole academic years behind 15-year-olds in China. In the last decade, we have plummeted down the international league tables: from 4th to 16th place in science; and from 8th to 28th in maths. While other countries - particularly Asian nations - have raced ahead we have, in the words of the OECD’s Director of Education, “stagnated.”</p><br/><br/><p>At undergraduate level, over half of degrees in China, Singapore and Japan are awarded in science and engineering subjects - compared to around a third in the UK, EU and US. The number of science and engineering degrees awarded in China more than trebled between 1998 and 2006. By comparison, those awarded in the United Kingdom and the United States remained relatively flat.</p><br/><br/><p>At postgraduate level, Asia now awards 1 in 4 of all engineering phds - almost as many as the EU and the USA combined. In the last 10 years for which we have figures, the number of scientific and technical journal articles published by Chinese researchers has almost quadrupled. In the UK, the increase has been just 3%. This focus on STEM is more than just academic - it translates into tangible, real-world innovations. Between 1999 and 2009, the number of patent applications by Chinese residents increased by over 1,000%. In the UK, it fell by a quarter.</p><br/><br/><p>For any politician anxious to ensure the next generation enjoy opportunities to flourish in an economy that is growing, in a nation that is confident and in a society that believes in progress, there is no escaping the centrality of mathematics and science. The imperative for maths and science education only grows as the strategic significance of cyberspace becomes daily more apparent. A point John Reid heavily underscores in his Cyber Doctrine speech today. Our capacity to innovate - vital to our security and resilience - is utterly dependent on education.</p><br/><br/><p>And when I see the pace at which other countries are transforming their education systems to give more and more of their students mastery in maths and science, it only reinforces my determination to reform our system here so our children can have access to the essential knowledge which truly empowers. If we are to keep pace with our competitors, we need fundamental, radical reform in the curriculum, in teaching, and in the way we use technology in the classroom. Unless we dramatically improve our performance, the grim arithmetic of globalisation will leave us all poorer.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""a-21st-century-curriculum"">A 21st century curriculum</h2><br/><br/><p>If we’re going to reverse our decline, we need to begin by looking at what is being taught. So we launched a National Curriculum Review to survey the academic evidence, investigate international best practice, and work with field-leading experts to come to a conclusion on what our children should be taught.</p><br/><br/><p>In maths and science, our Review Group has already been engaging with many of you. But we want this process to be as open, collaborative and informed as possible. So in August, we will share draft Programmes of Study with you all publicly for discussion and collaboration. And we will publish the evidence that informs our judgements so that everyone can see why we have made specific proposals. Through this collaborative, transparent process we hope to develop a National Curriculum that enjoy widespread support from the subject communities.</p><br/><br/><p>And it’s in that spirit of transparency that I also want today to clear up some misconceptions that have arisen.</p><br/><br/><p>The new National Curriculum is an exercise in intellectual liberation, not an attempt to prescribe every moment of the school day. We must revive a crucial distinction between the National Curriculum and the School Curriculum. The purpose of the National Curriculum is to set out the essential knowledge that children need to advance in core subjects. We then want to liberate teachers to decide on pedagogy - how those core subjects should be taught - and also to decide on what other subjects, or activities, should make up the whole school curriculum. In maths and science, the Expert Panel is focused on fundamental scientific knowledge and essential principles that are not subject to controversy and change every month or year.</p><br/><br/><p>There are many issues and controversies - from embryo experimentation to energy conservation -  which great teachers can use, as they wish, to create engaging and inspiring lessons. But there is no need to spell out in detail how these issues should be tackled in a National Curriculum. Indeed, filling it with topical subjects only encourages a constant tinkering and rewriting which we should stop. The National Curriculum should provide a foundation of knowledge. Great teachers, inspired by love for their subjects, should make the classroom come alive.</p><br/><br/><p>So, what should we concentrate on?</p><br/><br/><p>One of the lessons from the international evidence is that in East Asia there is much greater focus on fundamental number concepts, fractions and the building blocks of algebra in primary school. They have minimum standards that they aim to get practically all children to reach so they have a firm foundation for secondary. It may be, therefore, that we will adopt the same approach and have much more emphasis on pre-algebra in primary and remove data handling and some other subjects from the primary curriculum.</p><br/><br/><p>We should also bear in mind that in Shanghai, they have daily maths lessons and regular tests to make sure that all children are learning the basics.</p><br/><br/><p>Improving the foundations in primary would allow us to be more ambitious in the secondary curriculum.</p><br/><br/><p>Should, for example, calculus play a bigger part in the secondary curriculum? Obviously not everybody needs to study the more advanced calculus that is contained in the A level syllabus, but it seems to me genuinely bizarre that in the 21st Century so many children leave school essentially trapped in a mathematical world predating Newton and Leibniz, essentially unaware of the development of calculus.</p><br/><br/><p>And what about statistics? There are a vast array of issues that people are confronted with in daily life - from health scares to claims about the effect of drugs to financial news - which require statistical understanding. But studies have repeatedly shown how poor our collective understanding of such issues is. In its present form, GCSE maths does not enable children to understand conditional probability, normal distributions or randomness. Should this be something we should look to change?</p><br/><br/><p>And on a more fundamental level, it’s clear that not enough young people secure a basic level of competence in maths. Every year, about half of our pupils leave school without even a ‘C’ in maths GCSE. But it’s not just those pupils who give us cause for concern. We still send powerful signals throughout our education system that it’s somehow acceptable to give up on maths. Critically, we allow students to abandon any mathematical study after 16, in stark contrast to other developed nations. The ‘maths gap’ that most pupils now experience after the age of 16 means that even those who did well at GCSE have forgotten much of the maths they learnt by the time they start their degree or a job. ACME’s most recent figures on the take-up of mathematics among 17 year-olds is particularly worrying.</p><br/><br/><p>The latest figures are for 2009. Of the cohort of 660,000, three quarters were in full-time education.</p><br/><br/><p>286,000 students (c. 40% of the cohort) did A levels.</p><br/><br/><p>14,000 took maths to AS level.  Another 72,500 took full A level maths and of those 72,500 another 10,000 also did further maths.</p><br/><br/><p>In total that amounts to only about 85,000 pupils (just 13%) of the cohort doing A or AS maths, with only about 2% taking it to a high level.</p><br/><br/><p>Yet at the same time ACME’s research shows that about 330,000 16-18 students per year need to study maths and statistics at a level beyond GCSE (180,000 to a ‘physics or engineering’ level and another 150,000 to a ‘social science’ level). So our schools system is failing to provide anything like the number of suitably equipped students to meet the needs of Higher Education.</p><br/><br/><p>Only half the population has even basic maths skills, we are producing only about a quarter to a third of the number of pupils with the maths skills that our universities need, and economic trends mean that this gap will, unless we change, get wider and wider with all that entails for our culture and economy.</p><br/><br/><p>That is why I think we should set a new goal for the education system so that within a decade the vast majority of pupils are studying maths right through to the age of 18.</p><br/><br/><p>Of course, I am not prejudging the Review. But there are strong arguments for introducing concepts earlier, for covering some topics more thoroughly, and for making certain subjects compulsory for longer. It is a debate worth having, and one I hope many of you will choose to be involved in.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""the-importance-of-maths-and-science-teaching"">The importance of (maths and science) teaching</h2><br/><br/><p>Of course, if we’re going to change what we want children to be taught, we need to support those who will have to teach it.</p><br/><br/><p>Our White Paper, entitled ‘The Importance of Teaching’, made clear that maths and science are national strategic priorities and that we would target support to improve education in these subjects. We have allocated £135 million over the spending review period to support sustainable improvement in science and maths education in schools. A major part of this will focus on ensuring we have a teaching workforce that is ready to deliver.</p><br/><br/><p>So we’ll improve the supply of teachers with specialist subject knowledge in chemistry, physics and maths, through “conversion” courses that enable graduates of related disciplines to acquire the specialist subject knowledge necessary to train and serve as teachers in these subjects.</p><br/><br/><p>We’ll improving the skills of existing science and maths teachers through support for CPD - such as that offered by the national network of Science Learning Centres - where the Government is working in partnership with the Wellcome Trust and others in the universities and industry.</p><br/><br/><p>And we’ll offer high-achieving graduates, especially those in shortage subjects like science and maths, significantly better financial incentives to train as teachers - up to £20,000 for graduates with first class honours degree. Trainees will receive the bursary in monthly instalments in their training year, as currently happens.</p><br/><br/><p>We’ll also introduce Teaching Schools - modelled on teaching hospitals - to spread outstanding practice across the education system. Brilliant maths teachers in our best schools will be able to work across their school’s partnership mentoring and supporting those in weaker departments.</p><br/><br/><p>We are also committed to the existing programmes that have proven their worth over the past few years. For instance, the performance of the Further Maths Support Programme has been outstanding. The growth in the number taking Further Maths A level is testament to their success.</p><br/><br/><p>We protected the FMSP in the Spending Review and I can guarantee that their funding will not be cut for next year. However, this is not enough. They want to expand. That is why today, I have teamed up with CityAM to make an appeal to financial institutions in the City - put some of your profits into supporting the FMSP over the long-term, and ideally make it financially secure and not dependent on the temporary and easily lost affection of politicians.</p><br/><br/><p>Since the 2008 crisis, the financial pages have been full of laments from rich bankers and others bemoaning the lack of mathematical understanding among the population and among political leaders. OK, let’s do something about it. Although I personally strongly support the FMSP, I will not, many of you will be pleased to hear, be Secretary of State for ever. The health of organisations such as FMSP should not depend on a politician’s whim. It would be better if it had its own independent sources of money and I think many people would agree that the City has both an obligation and an incentive to help. Allister Heath, the paper’s brilliant editor, has today launched an appeal to his readers. Let’s hope this succeeds. I’m sure Adam Smith would approve - it would not only be a moral good but it would also be in the long-term interests of the City.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""harnessing-technology-in-the-classroom"">Harnessing technology in the classroom</h2><br/><br/><p>In addition to the debate over what is taught, and the issue of who does the teaching, we also need to think about how the teaching takes place. So as well as reviewing our curriculum and strengthening our workforce, we need to look at the way the very technological innovations we are racing to keep up with can help us along the way. We need to change curricula, tests and teaching to keep up with technology, and technology itself is changing curricula, tests, and teaching.</p><br/><br/><p>ItunesU now gives everybody with an internet connection access to the world’s best educational content. Innovations such as the Khan Academy are putting high quality lessons on the web. Extremely cheap digital cameras and the prevalence of the internet allow teachers to share best practice and learn from errors. Brilliant scientific publications such as Science are building their own ecosystems of educational content - resources that a central Government department could never hope to produce and maintain.</p><br/><br/><p>Computer games developed by Marcus Du Sautoy are enabling children to engage with complex mathematical problems that would hitherto have been thought too advanced. When children need to solve equations in order to get more ammo to shoot the aliens, it is amazing how quickly they can learn. I am sure that this field of educational games has huge potential for maths and science teaching and I know that Marcus himself has been thinking about how he might be able to create games to introduce advanced concepts, such as non-Euclidean geometry, to children at a much earlier stage than normal in schools.</p><br/><br/><p>The Department for Education is working with the Li Ka Shing Foundation and the highly respected Stanford Research Institute on a pilot programme to use computer programmes to teach maths. We have not developed the programme - we are just helping them run a pilot. Stanford say it is one of the most successful educational projects they have seen.</p><br/><br/><p>These developments are only beginning. They must develop on the ground - Whitehall must enable these innovations but not seek to micromanage them. The new environment of teaching schools will be a fertile ecosystem for experimenting and spreading successful ideas rapidly through the system.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h2><br/><br/><p>Overall, our vision for the future is clear. We are empowering teachers. We want schools to be more responsible to parents instead of to politicians. We are reducing bureaucracy as fast as we can. We want to reverse the devaluation of the exam system. We want a National Curriculum that acts as a foundation of core knowledge - not a detailed blueprint for lesson plans. And we unequivocally believe that maths and science education are at the heart of improving our society and our economy.</p><br/><br/><p>I look forward to the maths and science community engaging with our detailed proposals in the months ahead…</p><br/><br/></div></p>",

That means that four of those young people could be back in prison within a year. For adults released from custody, the re-offending rate is 47%. These figures are totally unacceptable in a modern society such as ours.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""who-are-these-people-most-likely-to-be"">Who are these people most likely to be?</h2><br/><br/><p>I’m afraid we simply don’t know. There are no reliable data on prisoners’ backgrounds. But small-scale research  published last year indicates that the very complex personal histories of people who are sentenced to prison include: being in care; experiencing abuse as a child; being excluded from school; having a family member who had spent time in custody; having no academic qualifications; and being unemployed at the time they committed the offence.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""hindsight-is-a-wonderful-thing"">Hindsight is a wonderful thing.</h2><br/><br/><p>We all know the political mantra: ‘Be tough on crime and the causes of crime’ and ‘Prison works’. I have no concerns that, as a society, we are tough on crime. Anyone here who has been a victim of crime will understand just how life-affecting, even life changing, it can be. But are we tough enough when it comes to understanding and investigating the causes of crime? My view is that we are tough on crime but not tough enough on the causes of crime. I intend to use this opportunity to explain what I mean.</p><br/><br/><p>Unusually for one of Her Majesty’s Inspectors, I’m going to start by making two assumptions, rather than triangulate the evidence.</p><br/><br/><p>The first assumption is that not everyone in this room has been inside a prison before today – I’m sure many of you have, but not everyone.</p><br/><br/><p>The second assumption is that even fewer of you have spent the night as a convicted criminal, deprived of your liberty in one of Her Majesty’s 123 prisons in England and Wales.</p><br/><br/><p>Personally, I have had the privilege and sometimes the misfortune to visit a good number of those 123 prisons. Thankfully, I have never spent the night as a convicted criminal.</p><br/><br/><p>Aside from the many hundreds of prisoners I have spoken with over the years, and the ‘night visits’ I have undertaken with my colleagues from HMIP, the nearest I have been to understanding what it might be like to be incarcerated was reading John’s book, ‘Inside’.</p><br/><br/><p>It is clear that being in a prison is no picnic and it’s not meant to be. The point is that society sets the sentence for the crime and expects it to be delivered out of sight. Protecting the public is a clear aim of our courts and quite correctly, it is the first objective of Her Majesty’s Prison Service and the reason for the 20-foot walls and iron gates you came through today. But a prison sentence also serves as a deterrent to others in order to support crime reduction. A sentence also aims to support the rehabilitation of offenders and serves as a punishment to the individual who stands convicted.</p><br/><br/><p>I am most concerned with the last two issues: punishment and rehabilitation. Let me put my cards on the table straight away. I think the punishment element of the sentence has unintended consequences that hinder a prisoner on their journey to being rehabilitated. This, in turn, contributes to the cycle of re-offending we see today. More on this in a moment.</p><br/><br/><p>So the 2 key and obvious challenges are to:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>stop people from coming into prison in the first place - in other words, being tough on the causes of crime</li><br/>  <li>and for those that do end up in a place like this, make sure it’s the one and only time - in other words, make sure that prison really does work</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Currently, just under a quarter of the total prison population is under the age of 25. That’s almost 20,000 young people who are incarcerated today.  For me, being tough on the causes of crime means engaging with those who present with characteristics most likely to lead to future criminal behaviour at the earliest possible age.</p><br/><br/><p>Sir Michael’s <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/unseen-children"">lecture on ‘Unseen children’</a> highlights the scandal that children from poorer backgrounds do much less well than their better off peers in our schools. These young people need to see their value and be motivated to learn and achieve before they are drawn into the influences that can lead to crime and, sadly, to a life of crime.</p><br/><br/><p>This brings me to the second issue, that of re-offending. For adults who have been in custody, the re-offending rate for the 12 months ending September 2011 was 47%. The re-offending rate for the same period for juveniles in custody was even more shocking at 72%. Almost three out of every four juveniles who left custody that year hadn’t managed to settle into a life that didn’t involve crime.</p><br/><br/><p>The challenge is to halt this cycle of re-offending, this revolving door, in and out of prison. The situation is only marginally better than it was 10 years ago.</p><br/><br/><p>Every prisoner costs the tax payer on average approximately £34,000 a year. Coincidentally, one year at Eton will also cost you around £34,000.</p><br/><br/><p>The reasons why an individual offends or even re-offends have long been the topic of much research and debate.</p><br/><br/><p>Employment is just one of the identified 7 key factors that individually, or more collectively, contribute to the preventing crime prevention. It is the one that I’m focusing on today.</p><br/><br/><p>Research has shown that being in employment can reduce the risk of re-offending significantly.  It wouldn’t take long for us all to put together the benefits of having a job. I’d propose:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>a sense of purpose and pride</li><br/>  <li>financial independence</li><br/>  <li>being given responsibility</li><br/>  <li>and, hopefully, having your contribution recognised</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Whatever the benefits, they must outweigh the pull towards criminal behaviour. Above all, there must be greater opportunities for ex-offenders to earn an honest wage through an honest job. Resettlement must not mean settling back into the life that leads to crime in the first place.</p><br/><br/><p>As you will have noted from the characteristics I mentioned previously, offenders do not generally have a history of secure employment. In a recently published survey, almost two thirds of prisoners had been in receipt of benefits at some point in the 12 months prior to coming into custody and 13% reported never having had a job.  And the chances of future employment are, frankly, far too bleak.</p><br/><br/><p>But the numbers simply don’t add up. There are currently about 6 job vacancies for every prisoner.</p><br/><br/><p>In skills shortage areas, such as manufacturing, accommodation and food services, there are approximately 89,000 unfilled jobs. That would give every prisoner a job today.</p><br/><br/><p>But, as we all know, it isn’t as easy as that. Even for those with good employability skills, being an ex-offender is the most significant barrier to employment.</p><br/><br/><p>The 2 main reasons for this remain the same as when I did my own master’s research just over 6 years ago.</p><br/><br/><p>There are still 2 extrinsic barriers:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the sentence aim – denunciation or censure; in other words, punishment. The sentence itself does not focus enough on positive resettlement or increasing the offenders’ chances of a job. For example, how often does a judge give the directive that an adult prisoner must complete an English or maths qualification?</li><br/>  <li>disclosure rules – as in the Rehabilitation of Offenders ACT 1974. I of course welcome the very recent amendments to the Act, but they don’t go far enough. For example, currently, a custodial sentence of up to six months must be declared for the next seven years. If you have been in prison for more than 30 months, you must declare your offence to a prospective employer for the rest of your life. Why is this? Why does the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act consider a prisoner is rehabilitated just by the passage of time? Or never in the case of those sentenced to more than 30 months?</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Nils Christie, a well-respected professor of criminology at Oslo University, said,</p><br/><br/><p>‘…a prisoner released after serving a sentence should always be met with an orchestra outside the walls. Later should follow the big, integrative feast. That would have been reintegration.’</p><br/><br/><p>The intrinsic barriers are equally challenging:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>employers’ attitudes to employing ex-offenders</li><br/>  <li>lack of vocational skills</li><br/>  <li>lack of employability skills</li><br/>  <li>lack of practical skills in English and maths</li><br/>  <li>and of course the other factors in reintegration pathways, especially accommodation, debt and drug and alcohol misuse</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>But I also wonder if the pull of what lured them into crime in the first place – the influences, the temptation, the downward spiral – are just far too difficult for some to overcome. But just because something is difficult doesn’t mean we should lower our expectations. Ambition is a powerful force to be reckoned with.</p><br/><br/><p>We all know that good quality education and training in prisons can make a significant difference to bringing offenders closer to the world of work. We have seen outstanding examples of prisons investing time and money to work with employers in partnership with the education and training provider and other organisations to enable prisoners to develop excellent vocational skills to high industry standards. But we also know that these examples are all too scarce.</p><br/><br/><p>Only 27 of the 78 prisons we have graded for learning and skills and work since 2009 were judged to be good for overall effectiveness or leadership and management at their latest inspection. That’s just 35%. None was outstanding. Eleven were inadequate – that’s nearly 15%. <br/>Too much education and training is simply not good enough.</p><br/><br/><p>If these figures related to our schools, there would be a national outcry. Secretaries of State would, I’m sure, be asked to resign. Yet this particular education provision is serving some of the country’s most vulnerable people and the taxpayer is footing the bill. And if the measure of its success is in re-offending rates, then 47% for adults and 72% for juveniles give no cause for celebration.</p><br/><br/><p>The catalogue of weaknesses that have remained over the years are unacceptable:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Poor attendance. How ironic, in an environment with the most captive of audiences. I understand that security is paramount in prisons, but poor attendance at work or training is all too often the result of poor management of regimes. All too often, FE and skills are simply not seen as a priority by prison staff.</li><br/>  <li>Poor punctuality. Motivation and enthusiasm can be a vital ingredient for making sure you’re always on time. But the regime needs to be such that it supports prisoners in getting to work on time.</li><br/>  <li>Weak careers information and advice. Prisoners are generally not getting sufficient direction from the National Careers Service to help plan their education and training in line with their plans for employment on release.</li><br/>  <li>Poor quality teaching. One of our inspectors witnessed a three-hour session on apostrophes.</li><br/>  <li>Vocational qualifications that are too low. Low level qualifications may be relevant for those who are completely new to a vocational area, but far too many prisoners gain qualifications that do little to show future employers their skills and potential.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>But an even greater weakness is when prisoners are locked up in their cells during the day and cannot attend training or work. A direct consequence of over-crowding perhaps?</p><br/><br/><p>I’d really like to know why the good and outstanding practice we have identified in one prison isn’t transferred to every other prison – or even, as in some cases, maintained in that prison.</p><br/><br/><p>Let me give you an example. In 1999, Lord Ramsbotham, the then Chief Inspector of Prisons, led the inspection of HMP Altcourse, a two-year-old category ‘B’ prison on the outskirts of Liverpool built and run by Group 4. David famously referred to the prison as ‘the jewel in the crown of the prison service’. With reference to the preparation of prisoners for the world of work, he commented:</p><br/><br/><p>’We were informed that local employers were not interested in prisoners having particular skills, but, more generally, having an attitude for work. This work ethic was central to the thinking of the Employment and Training Department and involved prisoners working a 40-hour-week which reflected, as much as possible, the real world of work. Prisoners were discouraged from having domestic visits during the working day and received a financial penalty if day-time visits were arranged.’</p><br/><br/><p>The report goes on to judge favourably the system of offenders being given pass keys that enabled them to make their own way through a prescribed and secure route from their cells to the workplace every day. Getting up, getting breakfast and making their own way to work on time was firmly the responsibility of the individual offender. Wages were proportionally cut if offenders turned up late for work. David also expressed his concern that, as this was a private prison, the public Prison Service would not take on board and share this good practice. He was right.</p><br/><br/><p>The learning and skills opportunities remained strong at the last inspection in 2012. So why isn’t every other prison doing this?</p><br/><br/><p>Very few prisons promote employability skills and attitudes effectively. For example, I observed one group doing restoration work on bicycles start the afternoon session with a 20-minute tea break.</p><br/><br/><p>Far too few prisoners enter prison and then leave it able to calculate a weekly budget, complete a simple work log book or follow written instructions on a work schedule. Data from initial assessments have shown that, in some prisons, about 75% of prisoners’ English and maths skills are assessed to be below the equivalent of a GCSE at grade C; 50% do not have the skills expected of an 11-year-old.</p><br/><br/><p>And the list can go on … But each one of those weaknesses mean that prisoners’ time is not being used to help them move closer to employment on release.</p><br/><br/><p>The core value of education and training in prisons must be, quite simply, giving every prisoner a second chance. For most prisoners, a sentence is a small but significant part of their lives: put there by society as a punishment for their crime; a moment to reflect – to hopefully show remorse. We must seize this moment. This is a captive audience. In every single prison in the country we have the most fantastic opportunity to do amazing things with the hardest to help in our society. But it needs energy, determination, enthusiasm and expertise – it needs the best teachers, the best managers and the best advisers. But above all, it needs commitment and a belief among prison staff and all the partners involved that giving every prisoner a second chance is the right thing to do.</p><br/><br/><p>Aside from the moral and social imperative, there is a clear financial driver – fewer prisoners, fewer prisons, more in employment, more income tax, less crime, more educated parents better able to support their own children’s education … I could go on.</p><br/><br/><p>It’s clear that there is no easy solution, but inspection over the years has helped us identify a pattern of key approaches that have led to successful progression to work for prisoners on release and ultimately lower occurrences of re-offending.</p><br/><br/><p>Getting employers such as Timpson’s involved not only in training but also developing prisoners’ employability skills is perhaps one of the most important components of good vocational provision in prisons.</p><br/><br/><p>We also need to promote of the advantages of working to offenders in prisons. They must be given a clear opportunity to see that there is a realistic alternative to crime. Ex-offenders with jobs in the community provide good role models.</p><br/><br/><p>I have seen some excellent training and work resources in prisons, but it takes investment and commitment by the companies and the prisons. It takes ambition and determination.</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Rail track training sites, such as at HMP Ranby and Wealstun, really do help prepare prisoners gain the rail track qualifications that almost guarantee a job and the pay is good.</li><br/>  <li>HMP Norwich has teamed up with local employers, such as the Chapelfield Shopping Centre, who provide excellent work experience and paid work for prisoners on release on temporary licence. Not only does this give prisoners a real experience of the world of work, it also provides proof that they are employable. As one prisoner said, the chance for work experience while in prison had helped him to feel normal again after being institutionalised for so long.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>If this can happen at these prisons, then why not at every prison?</p><br/><br/><p>The recent historic model of preparing offenders for work on release has focused on the education and training of offenders, supported by key performance targets (KPTs), with a heavy emphasis on basic skills. The problem with this model is that the KPTs become the driver, strategically. They lack clarity and they lack the individualisation that is required. The result is a steady stream of ex-offenders who are educated to a level and in skills that may hold little value with employers.</p><br/><br/><p>We have got to have more ambition. How many prison documentaries have we all seen where a prisoner is released and the officer instinctively turns to camera and says, ‘I’ll give him a week before he’s back’?</p><br/><br/><p>I am therefore proposing six recommendations that have at their core the aim to increase the number of prisoners who don’t return. I’ll take each one in turn.</p><br/><br/><p>They are about:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>sentencing</li><br/>  <li>delivery responsibility</li><br/>  <li>social responsibility</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>To start with sentencing, I return to my earlier point. What are prisons for? Holding prisoners securely is of course the first priority. They also have to respond to the judiciary by implementing the sentence that the judge passes. In the most severe of cases, this is achieved – for example a serial killer or a child murderer can expect the judge to state that they must be sent to prison in order to protect the public for the rest of one natural life. These cases are rare, but they provide clarity.</p><br/><br/><p>But surely there is need for a new model that would provide the same level of clarity in all cases?</p><br/><br/><p>So my first recommendation is to the government, to review further the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act and, rather than a one size fits all approach, consider empowering the courts to determine on a case by case basis the length of time that a conviction must be declared beyond the time spent in prison. This may or may not be conditional on the offender gaining, say, qualifications in English and maths while in prison. This would remove, or at least lower, the clear barrier to employment that nearly every ex-offender faces.</p><br/><br/><p>Moving on, I have 2 recommendations about the delivery responsibility.</p><br/><br/><p>The question is, how can we guarantee that prisons provide the best education, training and employment opportunities to equip prisoners for future employment? The answer is clear. A single line of accountability.</p><br/><br/><p>We are only one year into the cluster arrangements of prisons for contracting providers of offender learning and skills. But I have a real concern about the accountability of the training and education in prisons. It is too complex and needs to be located with the prison governor. Currently, a governor is directly accountable for the work activities in their prison – but not for the education contractor. If work activities are not up to scratch, actions can be taken. If education is not delivering, a long chain of people are involved, so in practice, nothing happens.</p><br/><br/><p>So my second recommendation is that the governing governor of a prison should have a clear responsibility for holding a contractor for education and training to account.</p><br/><br/><p>We also need to be clear that we are measuring and rewarding the right things. I’ve already mentioned the very low rates of progression to employment from prison. But these destination data are also unreliable as they frequently depend on prisoners’ intentions and not actual progression.</p><br/><br/><p>In being held responsible for the impact of education and training, prison governors should have the responsibility for identifying the prisoners’ employability on entering the prison (such as prior qualifications, English and maths skills, and experience of work) and their realistic employment aims to inform training while in prison. They should be held accountable for prisoners’ skill development while in prison and their actual progression to sustained employment or further education.</p><br/><br/><p>My third recommendation is therefore that targets should be based on prisoners’ development of vocational and employment-related skills at level 2 and above and their progression to sustained employment or further training on release.</p><br/><br/><p>This brings me to social responsibility. I started this lecture by asking the question, who are the people who commit a crime most likely to be? Are pupils eligible for free school meals more likely to end up in prison than those that are not on free school meals? Which areas of the country produce more prisoners? How is that linked to the number of people previously in care or excluded from schools? I said that we simply didn’t know as there were no reliable data on prisoners’ backgrounds.</p><br/><br/><p>So my fourth recommendation is to the National Offender Management Service to gather reliable information about the characteristics of all prisoners entering the prison system. This information should then provide the background for our collective social responsibility to provide more targeted support to help avert young people from entering a life of crime.</p><br/><br/><p>Alongside this, a fundamental and crucial omission from the current model is any indication of collective social responsibility to engage with those who do end up in prison. For example, employers are actually protected from ex-offenders by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.</p><br/><br/><p>Very few employers engage with and employ ex-offenders and I recognise that they need support to do so. There is a greater need for prisons to engage with employers of all sizes.</p><br/><br/><p>The government is committed to reorganising the prison estate and to creating 70 resettlement prisons. A secure college for juveniles is also likely to become a reality. These developments are to be welcomed. We must, however, seize this moment to reconsider what makes a successful prison.</p><br/><br/><p>This is also the opportunity to break down the natural barriers that many employers have to employing ex-offenders. The employers in this room have shown that it is possible.</p><br/><br/><p>This is also an opportunity to seriously consider whether the prison officers who will be working in the resettlement prisons require a higher level of education than is currently the case so that they can have a direct impact in supporting prisoners’ rehabilitation on release from custody. Currently, a prison officer can be recruited without any qualifications themselves. And I have met some outstanding officers who have so much more to offer. Let’s find ways to incentivise them.</p><br/><br/><p>My fifth recommendation is that the prison regime in the 70 resettlement prisons is built round the working day, as successfully achieved at HMP Altcourse.</p><br/><br/><p>This would help to develop the sense of personal responsibility and prevent the institutionalised dependencies that can act as a barrier to self-sufficiency on release. The resettlement prisons provide an excellent opportunity to make this more systemic across the estate.</p><br/><br/><p>This would of course need to be closely linked with the need to engage employers in resettlement work in prisons.</p><br/><br/><p>This brings me to my sixth and final recommendation that, in the same way that the government is consulting on ways to engage employers in their flagship apprenticeship programme, serious consideration should be given to extending those same incentives to those who train and employ ex-offenders.</p><br/><br/><p>The approach does not require employers to employ ex-offenders, but it would incentivise them. It is intended to build on the excellent examples of employer engagement that already exist:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>collaboration on course design so that skills development on prison courses would match employers’ requirements</li><br/>  <li>guaranteed interviews for the ex-offender</li><br/>  <li>support for employers and the ex-offenders through the training provider and Probation Trusts, or whatever they evolve into</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""so-where-does-inspection-come-in"">So where does inspection come in?</h2><br/><br/><p>In prison inspections, Ofsted will continue to focus on the quality and impact of the FE and skills and work provision. We will be unrelenting in our criticism of unacceptable and poor practice. These prisoners need the best teachers, the best careers advice and the skills that employers are looking for today. Not 10 years ago. But our role is also to celebrate and disseminate good practice where we find it. There are currently 11 examples of good practice on our website. And there needs to be more.</p><br/><br/><p>Finally, this is not just about prison inspection. It’s about our inspection of schools and colleges and social care settings for looked-after children. I don’t want to rehearse the recommendations made by Sir Michael in his ‘Unseen children’ speech, but it is safe to say that a good number of those children Michael was talking about, those poorer children who were failed by successive years in the education and care system, will end up here – in places like Wormwood Scrubs.  We all have a role to stop that happening.</p><br/><br/><p>I now invite you to watch a brief video to demonstrate that with determination and ambition… This can be done.</p><br/></div></p>",

The National Union of Students have recommended they do so and Universities UK has also asked universities to individually consider adoption.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Last year the OfS provided £480,000 for 11 projects tackling religious-based hate crime in higher education. One of the projects, led by King’s College London, aims to tackle religious intolerance and includes recognising the needs of religious communities within the university, strengthening reporting mechanisms, supporting new facilities as well as building awareness, understanding and tolerance of different faiths. King’s is also one of the first universities to accept the full IHRA definition of antisemitism.</p><br/><br/><p>Universities UK (UUK) has set up a taskforce to consider what can be done to address violence, harassment and hate crime on campus, including on the basis of religion. The taskforce published a comprehensive report ‘Changing the Culture’ in 2016 which included a number of specific recommendations for the higher education sector on antisemitism.</p><br/><br/><p>Many universities have made good progress on this, but there is still further to go to implement UUK’s recommendations fully. All higher education providers should also have robust policies and reporting procedures in place and investigate and swiftly address reports of hate crime, including any antisemitic incidents that are reported.</p><br/></div></p>",

This is my first Limmud Festival, and it is a revelation for me: I did not fully realise what a remarkable gathering the conference is.</p><br/><br/><p>It is a banquet of ideas and discussion, a national institution for the community, and an international success story: since the first conference in Britain in 1980, it has been replicated by Jewish communities all over the world, from South Africa to New Zealand, and from Finland to Chile.</p><br/><br/><p>There is one thing in particular I find admirable about the Festival, and it sits at the heart of what I want to say today.</p><br/><br/><p>That is its focus on the free exchange of diverse, even conflicting views. There are few places where you can hear from a government minister and from Jon Lansman of Momentum, and from speakers on subjects ranging from Kafka to stand-up comedy to tech startups, all on the same platform.</p><br/><br/><p>This spirit of open, frank and rigorous discussion is refreshing and invigorating.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""the-liberal-tradition"">The liberal tradition</h3><br/><br/><p>And, of course, this love of open debate represents just one of many contributions that Britain’s Jewish community has made to our country’s tradition of liberalism and openness.</p><br/><br/><p>As the historian Abigail Green has pointed out, the British liberal tradition owes a profound debt to so many members of the Jewish community.</p><br/><br/><p>To Isaiah Berlin, who helped to reinvent Western liberalism in the post-war era.</p><br/><br/><p>To Peter Benenson, the founder of Amnesty International.</p><br/><br/><p>To Herscht Lauterpacht, one of the fathers of modern international law.</p><br/><br/><p>To Rosalind Franklin, the chemist whose work informs our current understanding of DNA.</p><br/><br/><p>To Herbert Samuel, the liberal politician and instigator of the Balfour Declaration, the 100th anniversary of which we celebrated in November.</p><br/><br/><p>And to countless others.</p><br/><br/><p>This is a tradition that is particularly important to me in my role as universities minister.</p><br/><br/><p>A university is the quintessential liberal institution. Not liberal in a narrow party political sense, but in the true liberal of free and rigorous inquiry, of liberty and of tolerance.</p><br/><br/><p>The liberal tradition is a noble and important one; but today it finds itself under threat. Liberal politics are under threat from national and populist parties around the world. Economic liberalism is under threat from those who turn to protectionism for quick-fix solutions to complex problems.</p><br/><br/><p>And the liberal tradition in universities faces challenges too.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""threats-to-freedom-of-speech"">Threats to freedom of speech</h3><br/><br/><p>A particularly worrying challenge to universities as bastions of liberalism comes from the threat to legal free speech and to open debate on our campuses.</p><br/><br/><p>Our universities, rather like the Festival we are today, should be places that open minds not close them, where ideas can be freely challenged and prejudices exposed.</p><br/><br/><p>But in universities in America and increasingly in the United Kingdom, there are countervailing forces of censorship, where groups have sought to stifle those who do not agree with them in every way under the banner of “safe spaces” or “no-platforming”.</p><br/><br/><p>However well-intentioned, the proliferation of such safe spaces, the rise of no-platforming, the removal of ‘offensive’ books from libraries and the drawing up of ever more extensive lists of banned “trigger” words are undermining the principle of free speech in our universities.</p><br/><br/><p>Without that basic liberal principle, our universities will be compromised.</p><br/><br/><p>Spinoza, that forerunner of modern liberalism, said that intellectual freedom was “absolutely necessary for progress in science and the liberal arts”.</p><br/><br/><p>Indeed, in 1673 Spinoza refused a prestigious appointment as professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg, because the job offer came with a restriction on what he could say - a stipulation that he must “not insult the principles of the established religion”.</p><br/><br/><p>Shield young people from controversial opinions, views that challenge their most profoundly held beliefs or simply make them uncomfortable, and you are on the slippery slope that ends up with a society less able to make scientific breakthroughs, to be innovative and to resist injustice.</p><br/><br/><p>I am glad to say that, for the time being at least, censorship in our universities is the exception, not the rule.</p><br/><br/><p>A 2016 survey showed that 83% of students felt free to express views on campus. And I have been hearted by cases of students themselves standing in the way of attempts to restrict freedom of speech.</p><br/><br/><p>But this is no time for complacency.</p><br/><br/><p>Like me, you have no doubt read reports of examples of censorship, where groups have sought to stifle those who do not agree with them in every way under the banners of “safe spaces” or “no-platforming” in US, signs that it might be spreading to UK.</p><br/><br/><p>Campaigns and protests against events featuring prominent gay rights and feminist campaigners such as Peter Tatchell and Julie Bindel, and more recently the proposal by some students at Oxford’s Balliol College to deny the Christian Union a space at Fresher’s Fair are examples of the threat to legal free speech from those who would rather shut down debate altogether than to confront dissenting ideas or uncomfortable arguments.</p><br/><br/><p>That’s why the government is taking action now.</p><br/><br/><p>As part of our reforms to higher education, we have set up a new regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), which, as its name suggests, will regulate the university sector in a way that puts the interests of students first.</p><br/><br/><p>Created by the Higher Education &amp; Research Act 2017, the OfS will come into being next week.</p><br/><br/><p>Promoting freedom of speech within the law will be at the heart of its approach to the regulation of our higher education system.</p><br/><br/><p>The OfS will go further than its predecessor in promoting freedom of speech.</p><br/><br/><p>In the Act, we extended the existing statutory duty on universities to secure free speech in the Education (No.2) Act 1986 so that it will apply to all providers of higher education registered with the OfS.</p><br/><br/><p>Furthermore, as a condition of registration with the new regulator, we are proposing that all universities benefitting from public money must demonstrate a clear commitment to free speech in their governance documents.</p><br/><br/><p>And the OfS will in turn use its regulatory powers to hold them to account for ensuring that lawful freedom of speech is upheld by their staff and students.</p><br/><br/><p>This is no authoritarian step.</p><br/><br/><p>Nor is it somehow the “opposite” of free speech, as has been suggested by Harriet Harman, whose Joint Committee on Human Rights is gathering evidence on freedom of speech in UK higher education.</p><br/><br/><p>On the contrary, it is simply Government playing its part in actively creating the conditions necessary for our universities to serve as the vibrant free-trading marketplaces for ideas that we need them to be.</p><br/><br/><p>What do we mean by universities as ‘marketplaces of ideas’? It means our universities enabling truth to emerge and the frontiers of knowledge to expand as a result of the competition of ideas in free, transparent public discourse.</p><br/><br/><p>Whether it’s Gallileo’s heretical rejection of geocentrism, Darwin’s godless theory of creation or the bravery of dissidents resisting oppression all over the world, history shows the right to disagree is the cornerstone of intellectual and political freedom.</p><br/><br/><p>I am pleased to say that this freedom is as important to the OfS’s new chairman, Sir Michael Barber, as it is to me.</p><br/><br/><p>In a recent article entitled “In Defence of Uncomfortable”, arguing that universities need to foster a climate of open inquiry in order to provide a truly valuable education, Michael pointed out that “Diversity of view and disagreement, is a vital ingredient of places of higher learning”.</p><br/><br/><p>While he hoped the OfS never has to intervene in a university in relation to freedom of speech, he undertook that, if it does, it will be to widen it rather than restrict it.</p><br/><br/><p>I’m confident freedom of speech in our universities has a bright future under the OfS.</p><br/><br/><p>But we will continue to watch the system carefully.</p><br/><br/><p>And I want to be clear about this: attempts to silence opinions that one disagrees with have no place in the English university system. Academics and students alike must not allow a culture to take hold where silence is preferable to a dissenting voice.</p><br/><br/><p>If we want our universities to thrive, we must defend the liberal values of freedom of speech and diversity of opinion on which they depend.</p><br/><br/><p>Freedom of speech within the law must prevail in our society, with only the narrowest necessary exceptions justified by specific countervailing public policies.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""standing-firm-against-antisemitism-on-campus"">Standing firm against antisemitism on campus</h3><br/><br/><p>One threat that you will be all too aware of comes from anti-semitism on campus. There is no doubt that for many Jewish students their experience at university is overwhelmingly positive.</p><br/><br/><p>However, the number of anti-semitic incidents in the UK, including in our universities, remains a cause for concern. Anti-semitic incidents, whether from the far right, or from a virulent far left strain, have included Holocaust denial leaflets distributed at Cambridge University and swastikas at Exeter University.</p><br/><br/><p>Last October, it was reported that police were called to University College London to quell a violent anti-Israel protest which left Jewish students barricaded in a room, after being told their safety could not be guaranteed if they left alone.</p><br/><br/><p>I am concerned that there has been a climate on campus in which fewer than half (49 per cent) of Jewish students surveyed said they would feel comfortable attending NUS events.</p><br/><br/><p>This is unacceptable.</p><br/><br/><p>I’m encouraged that the NUS’s new leadership, under Shakira Martin, has taken a more positive direction, including a partnership with the Union of Jewish Students and Holocaust Education Trust for a Holocaust education campaign.  I hope this continues.</p><br/><br/><p>There is no place in our society - including within higher education – for hatred or any form of discrimination or racism such as anti-Semitism.</p><br/><br/><p>A racist and anti-semitic environment is by definition an illiberal one that is totally antithetical to the idea of a university in a free society.</p><br/><br/><p>Working together with universities, with bodies like Universities UK, and with campaigners such as Baroness Deech and Sir Eric Pickles, we are working to combat antisemitism on campus, and I believe we are making progress.</p><br/><br/><p>I have been working hard to tackle this.</p><br/><br/><p>In February I wrote to Universities UK, the representative body of the UK higher education sector, as well as to alternative providers, to ensure they had noted the Government’s adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism.</p><br/><br/><p>At my request, this has been shared throughout the higher education sector.</p><br/><br/><p>It is essential that institutions must have robust procedures in place. I expect them to demonstrate how they will act quickly to investigate and address all allegations of hate crime, including allegations of anti-Semitism.</p><br/><br/><p>This is an integral part of ensuring they provide a safe and inclusive environment for all students and that students do not face discrimination, harassment or victimisation.</p><br/><br/><p>In June last year, at my request, Universities UK agreed to consider the issue of hate crime on campus on the basis of religion and belief as part of their Harassment Taskforce.</p><br/><br/><p>Its key recommendations to universities included the adoption of a zero tolerance approach to anti-semitism, training for staff on antisemitism and development of close ties between universities and local Jewish community leaders.</p><br/><br/><p>UUK has also published the first of their case studies looking at good practice at the sector on harassment and hate crime and I hope that institutions are aware, and making good use, of these.</p><br/><br/><p>To support this work, I asked the Higher Education Funding Council (HEFCE) to prioritise working with Universities UK in 2017-2018 on these important issues.</p><br/><br/><p>And as a result, they have provided over £4m funding for projects to tackle harassment and hate crime. This includes £1.8m of funding for over 40 universities and colleges for projects which aim to tackle online harassment and hate.</p><br/><br/><p>But there is much more to do.</p><br/><br/><p>Universities cannot afford to be complacent about complying either with their duties to protect freedom of speech, or anything less than vigilant against hate speech (or other unlawful activity) masquerading as the exercise of the right to freedom of speech.</p><br/><br/><p>Both duties are vitally important to a civilised democratic society.</p><br/></div></p>",
